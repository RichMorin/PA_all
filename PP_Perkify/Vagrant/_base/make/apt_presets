# JACK, jackd2, audio support
# orig: 1.9.12~dfsg/
#
#   "If you want to run jackd with realtime priorities, the user starting
#   jackd needs realtime permissions. Accept this option to create the file
#   /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf, granting realtime priority and memlock
#   privileges to the audio group.
# 
#   Running jackd with realtime priority minimizes latency, but may lead to
#   complete system lock-ups by requesting all the available physical system
#   memory, which is unacceptable in multi-user environments.
#
#   Enable realtime process priority?"
#     -> Odd that this isn't set by the -y option.
#     -> This should probably be answered "no".
#
#   Running this manually caused the MB Air to reboot (RAM issue?).
#   Also, this may be getting installed automagically (?).  Investigate...

# KDE, kde-full, window manager

#    "A display manager is a program that provides graphical login capabilities

#    Only one display manager can manage a given X server, but multiple display
#    manager packages are installed. Please select which display manager should
#    run by default.
# 
#    Multiple display managers can run simultaneously if they are configured
#    to manage different servers; to achieve this, configure the display
#    managers accordingly, edit each of their init scripts in /etc/init.d,
#    and disable the check for a default display manager.
#
#    Default display manager:

#   Default display manager:
#   -> dialog is the same as in kde-full, except it offers nodm.

#
#   Designed for embedded or kiosk systems, nodm starts an X session for a user
#   without asking for authentication. On regular machines, this has security
#   implications and is therefore disabled by default.
