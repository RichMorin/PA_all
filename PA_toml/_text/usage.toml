This page is a tutorial walkthrough of the site's usage.
For best results, skim the material first, then try things out.

### Areas

Pete's Alley stores its [curated]{con_ove|PA_Curation} "items"
in two top-level [Areas]{/area}: [Catalog]{cat|:a} and [Content]{con|:a}.
The Catalog area contains information on disability-related resources.
It contains sections for [Groups]{cat_gro|:a}, [Hardware]{cat_har|:a},
[People]{cat_peo|:a}, [Services]{cat_ser|:a}, and [Software]{cat_sof|:a}.
The Content area is a collection of long-form written material,
including [Essays]{con_ess|:a}, [HowTos]{con_how|:a}, and
[Overviews]{con_ove|:a}.

Each section has a detailed, alphabetical index page,
providing the name and a precis of each indexed item.
If you know the name of the item you want (or a plausible keyword),
you should use your browser to search this page.
However, if you don't know the name of the item you want,
and don't want to scan long lists of possibilities,
you may want to try our tag-based Search facility, described below.

### Links

Pete's Alley uses links in various ways:

- action links   (e.g., initiate an email message)
- control links  (e.g., hide or show page content)
- external links (jump to a page on another site)
- internal links (jump to another page on the site)
- on-page links  (jump to another part of the page)

In general, it should be possible to determine what a link will do
by reading the link's text and/or URL.
That said, if you don't know what a link does, just try it out!
You won't hurt anything and you can always go back to the original page.

### Progressive Disclosure

Some of our pages contain a _lot_ of information.
In order to make this less time-consuming to work with,
we use a form of [progressive disclosure]{ext_wp|Progressive_disclosure}.
The "hide" and "show" control links act as complementary
[disclosure widgets]{ext_wp|Disclosure_widget},
controlling a single level of the page.
The "hide all" and "show all" links control multiple levels,
hiding or showing all subsidiary levels.

To reduce clutter, some parts of a page may start out in "hide" mode.
For example, the (table of) Contents section acts in this manner.
Click "show" or "show all" as needed
to allow scanning, printing, and searching tasks.
Certain sequences of clicks are also useful.
For example, clicking "hide all" and then "show"
will hide the details but allow the headings to be shown.

### Navigation

Pete's Alley makes heavy use of navigation links, both internal and external.
(Internal links jump to another part of our web site;
external links jump to other sites.)
Our pages tend to be fairly small and our server is quite efficient,
so following an internal link should be quite speedy.
Of course, following an external link may take a bit longer...

#### Page Header

The page header contains several internal links:

- [Pete's Alley ]{_text/home.toml}    - the home (landing) page
- [About        ]{_text/about.toml}   - background information
- [Catalog      ]{cat|:a}             - links to Catalog sections
- [Content      ]{con|:a}             - links to Content sections
- [Search       ]{/search/find}       - tag-based search tool
- [Usage        ]{_text/usage.toml}   - tutorial on site usage

#### Page Footer

The page footer may contain additional links, including:

- Dashboard   - display dynamic site information
- Feedback    - create an email message template
- Source      - display the source code for an item
- Edit        - create or edit source code for an item

#### Index Pages

Some of the section index pages, such as [Groups]{cat_gro|:a},
will eventually have large numbers of entries.
To ease on-page navigation,
there is a set of single-character "Index" links (e.g., 2, A, ...).
Each of these jumps to the heading
for entries whose titles begin with that character.
Note that links can only jump to content that is being shown.

#### Item Pages

Item pages in the Catalog area are intended to help you find out
about organizations, products, services, etc.
Along with a precis and a description,
they provide whatever contact information we've been able to find.
So, they have many types of links, including:

- area pages for the current path
- item pages for each author
- item pages for related items
- official and related web sites
- wikipedia links for terminology

Item pages in the Content area have fewer fixed elements;
each author gets to decide the manner and order of presentation.
That said, these items will generally make use of common HTML elements
such as headers, lists, and tables.

### Search

Our [Search]{/search/find} facility uses a powerful and flexible approach,
based on combinations of tags.
However, using the facility effectively requires a bit of skill,
so let's go over the conceptual model and some
of the operational details.

Each item has a set of tags, organized by value within type.
So, for example, values such as `immersable` or `speech synthesis`
might appear under the `features` type.
This helps to ease specification of tags, reduce ambiguity, etc.
For a detailed discussion of this topic,
visit [Pete's Alley - Typed Tags]{con_ove|PA_Typed_Tags}.

#### Define a search

One or more tags may be used to define a search,
using textual entry and/or interactive selection.
If you know what tag(s) you're looking for,
simply type them into the "Search Text" text area,
then click the `Submit` button.
For example, you could enter `algebraic` or (for more precision)
`features:algebraic`.

*Note:*
Typeless tags are displayed with the type `_`.
So, for example, `foo` is displayed as `_:foo`.
Feel free to enter typeless tags in either format.

If you don't know the type or value of the tag you need,
try using the interactive selection approach.
After opening up the `features` type (using the `show` link),
click the checkboxes for `algebraic` and `compact`,
adding them to the search query.
Finally, click the `Submit` button to process the search
and display the "Search Results" page.

The first section of this page, Selections,
will show a set of Defined tags, labeled `a`.
The next section, Results, will show items matching the
[Intersection]{ext_wp|Intersection} and
[Union]{ext_wp|Union_(set_theory)} of the selections.
In this example, the Intersection area will display items
for which _all_ of the `a` tags match and
the Union area will display items
for which _any_ of the `a` tags match.
Typically, the Union section will contain far more items
than the Intersection section does.

#### Reuse a search

Going back to the Search page, you'll notice that there
is now a "Reuse a search" heading.
This lets us combine previous queries with new selections.
The query we just made (`a`) will be shown, along with a set
of radio buttons (labeled `all`, `any`, and `none`).
These let us specify whether and how to reuse the query.

Click the `all` button on query `a`,
then specify `roles: screen reader` (in "Define a search‚Äù)",
and click `Submit`.
The Selections area will now show both Defined and Reused.
(e.g., `b` and `a: all`)
Once again, it will display the Intersection and Union
of the specified terms.

The Intersection result now includes items that match
all of the tags in selections `a` and `b`.
The Union result includes
items that match all of the tags in selection `a` or
any of the tags in selection `b`.

Selecting the version (`all` or `any`) of previously defined queries
seems like a very general mechanism for composition.
However, our implementation may need some polishing
or added infrastructure to be really convenient.
So, feedback (with use cases!) is earnestly requested.

### Submissions

You are strongly encouraged to submit feedback on Pete's Alley.
If you simply want to send us a comment or suggestion,
email is the recommended approach.
Navigate to an appropriate page on Pete's Alley,
then click the Feedback link at the end of the page.
This should open up a piece of outgoing email,
complete with proper address and subject information.
Put your feedback (e.g., "please add the `foo:bar` tag")
in the message body, then send the email off to us.

If you want to submit substantial changes to a page
or entirely new content (e.g., an article or review),
there are better ways to do it.
However, there is a bit more of a learning curve involved.
