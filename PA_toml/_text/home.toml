### Announcing Perkify

[Rich Morin]{cat_peo|Rich_Morin} has put together
an early release of [Perkify]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Intro},
a blind-friendly [virtual machine]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine}
for use on [personal computers]{ext_wp|Personal_computer}.
Based on [Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu}, [Vagrant]{ext_wp|Vagrant_(software)},
and [VirtualBox]{ext_wp|VirtualBox},
Perkify can be used on most 64-bit Intel platforms
(e.g, [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux}, [macOS]{ext_wp|MacOS},
[Windows]{ext_wp|Microsoft_Windows}).
The initial distribution contains about 2500
[open source]{ext_wp|Open_source}
[packages]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Packages},
mostly installed via
[Debian]{ext_wp|Debian}'s
Advanced Package Toolkit ([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(Package_Manager)}).

Although most of the commands should Just Work,
the accessibility-related packages clearly need to be tested.
Some (e.g., BRLTTY, Orca) will need configuration and/or porting.
There are also several programs (e.g., Emacspeak, The vOICe)
which were left out because they lack APT installation packages.
If this effort sounds intriguing,
please [check it out]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Intro}!
