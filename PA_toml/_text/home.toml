for long-form communication (e.g., articles, howtos), etc.

### Motorcycle Pages (2019.10)

When Rich Morin isn't working on projects such as Pete's Alley and Perkify,
he likes to ride his motorcycle (a 1983 BMW R80ST)
into the hills around the San Francisco Bay Area.
Here are a couple of pages that may be of interest to other riders:

- [Crash Scene Reference Sheet
  ]{con_ove|MC_Crash_Scene]

- [R80ST Modifications
  ]{con_ove|MC_R80ST_Mods]

### VOISS Pages (2019.10)

[VOISS]{con_ove|PP_VOISS_Index} has released
an open source design for an economical talking computer
that is completely adapted for use by the blind.
A compliant system can be assembled and maintained by a blind user,
using open source software and readily-available hardware components.
In an effort to encourage uptake of this platform,
[Rich Morin]{cat_peo|Rich_Morin} has created several
[Overview]{con_ove|:a} pages and a start on a [HowTo]{con_how|PP_VOISS_HowTo}.

### Announcing Perkify (2019.09)

[Rich Morin]{cat_peo|Rich_Morin} has put together
an early release of [Perkify]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Intro},
a blind-friendly [virtual machine]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine}
for use on [personal computers]{ext_wp|Personal_computer}.
Based on [Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu}, [Vagrant]{ext_wp|Vagrant_(software)},
and [VirtualBox]{ext_wp|VirtualBox},
Perkify can be used on most 64-bit Intel platforms
(e.g, [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux}, [macOS]{ext_wp|MacOS},
[Windows]{ext_wp|Microsoft_Windows}).
The initial distribution contains about 2500
[open source]{ext_wp|Open_source}
[packages]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Pkg_List},
mostly installed via
[Debian]{ext_wp|Debian}'s
Advanced Package Toolkit ([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(Package_Manager)}).

Although most of the commands should Just Work,
the accessibility-related packages clearly need to be tested.
Some (e.g., BRLTTY, Orca) will need configuration and/or porting.
There are also several programs (e.g., Emacspeak, The vOICe)
which were left out because they lack APT installation packages.
If this effort sounds intriguing,
please [check it out]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Intro}!
