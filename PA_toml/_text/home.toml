### Noteworthy Content

Here are some brief notes about noteworthy content on the site.

#### VOISS - an economical talking computer

Sadly, the VOISS project ran out of funding and has been discontinued.
However, the [Stormux]{https://stormux.org} project
is trying to pick up some of the pieces; stay tuned for announcements!

> [VOISS]{con_ove|VOISS_Index} has released
an open source design for an economical talking computer
that is completely adapted for use by the blind.
A compliant system can be assembled and maintained by a blind user,
using open source software and readily-available hardware components.
In an effort to encourage uptake of this platform,
[Rich Morin]{cat_peo|Rich_Morin} has created several
[Overview]{con_ove|:a} pages and a start on a [HowTo]{con_how|VOISS_HowTo}.
For details, see the VOISS [index page]{con_ove|VOISS_Index}.

#### Perkify - a blind-friendly virtual machine

[Rich Morin]{cat_peo|Rich_Morin} has put together and published
some early releases of [Perkify]{con_ove|Perkify_Intro},
a blind-friendly [virtual machine]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine}
for use on [personal computers]{ext_wp|Personal_computer}.
Based on [Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu}, [Vagrant]{ext_wp|Vagrant_(software)},
and [VirtualBox]{ext_wp|VirtualBox},
Perkify can be used on most 64-bit AMD/Intel platforms
(e.g, [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux}, [macOS]{ext_wp|MacOS},
[Windows]{ext_wp|Microsoft_Windows}).
For details, see the Perkify [introduction]{con_ove|Perkify_Intro}.

#### Motorcycle-related Resources

When [Rich Morin]{cat_peo|Rich_Morin} isn't working
on projects such as Pete's Alley and Perkify,
he likes to ride his motorcycle (a 1983 BMW R80ST)
into the hills around the San Francisco Bay Area.
He has also written up some pages that may be useful to other riders.
For details, see the [index page]{con_ove|MC_Index}.
