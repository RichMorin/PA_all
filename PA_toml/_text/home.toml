  verbose     = '''
This is an early prototype of Pete's Alley.
The site is planned as an online resource for the disabled community,
including their friends, relatives, and other supporters.
It will index and review resources, provide communication channels, etc.

Before trying to use the site for the first time, please skim the
[About]{_text/about.toml} and [Usage]{_text/usage.toml} pages.
They should help you to avoid confusion and get up to speed quickly.
