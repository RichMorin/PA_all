> This is an adaptation of the espeakup program specifically for the
Raspberry Pi.  It lets speakup use the eSpeak software synthesizer.

> It uses the OpenMAX Integration Layer Client library I have written
to render text-to-speech directly on the Broadcom GPU and thus avoid
ALSA, pulseaudio, etc.

> I did this because at the time of writing the Broadcom sound-driver
on the Raspberry Pi is seriously broken for eSpeak TTS.  It stutters
very badly and regularly crashes the kernel.
