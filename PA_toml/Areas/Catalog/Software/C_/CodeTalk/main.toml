> CodeTalk is a step towards making programming IDEs more accessible.
The plugin currently concentrates on three main aspects of Programming:

- Glanceability
- Real-Time Error information
- Accessible Debugging

CodeTalk is currently only available for Visual Studio running in Windows
for C# and Python languages.
We are working very hard towards bringing it to more platforms and IDEs.
Stay tuned.
