> KNOPPIX ... is an operating system based on Debian designed to be run
directly from a CD / DVD (Live CD) or a USB flash drive (Live USB),
one of the first of its kind for any operating system.
Knoppix was developed by, and named after, Linux consultant Klaus Knopper.
When starting a program, it is loaded from the removable medium and
decompressed into a RAM drive. The decompression is transparent and on-the-fly.

> Although KNOPPIX is primarily designed to be used as a Live CD,
it can also be installed on a hard disk like a typical operating system.
Computers that support booting from USB devices can load KNOPPIX
from a live USB flash drive or memory card.
