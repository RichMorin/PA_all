  verbose     = '''
> KmPlot is a powerful mathematical plotter for KDE,
capable of plotting multiple functions simultaneously
and combining them into new functions.

> Cartesian, parametric, and differential functions are supported,
as well as functions using polar coordinates.
Plots are printed with high precision at the correct aspect ratio.

> KmPlot also provides numerical and visual features
such as filling and calculating the area between the plot and the first axis,
finding maxima and minima, changing function parameters dynamically,
and plotting derivatives and integral functions.

> This package is part of the KDE education module.
