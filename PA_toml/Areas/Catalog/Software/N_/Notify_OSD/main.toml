> Canonical's on-screen-display notification agent, implementing
the freedesktop.org Desktop Notifications Specification
with semi-transparent click-through bubbles.

> The freedesktop.org Desktop Notifications Specification
provides a standard way for applications to display pop-up notifications.
These are designed to make you aware of something,
without interrupting your work with a window you must close.

> Notify OSD presents these notifications as ephemeral overlays,
which can be clicked through so they don't block your work.
It queues notifications, to prevent them from flooding your screen.
And as well as handling standard notification updates,
Notify OSD introduces the idea of appending â€”
allowing notifications to grow over time, for example in the case
of instant messages from a particular person.
