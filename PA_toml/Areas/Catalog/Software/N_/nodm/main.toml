> nodm is a minimal display manager that simply logs in as a given user
and starts an X session, without asking for username or password.

> On a normal computer, using nodm is a big security issue
because it would give anyone access to the computer.

> However, there are cases where automatic login is needed:
for example, in an embedded system such as a mobile phone,
or in a kiosk setup, or in a control panel for industrial machinery.
For those cases, nodm is simple to setup, lightweight,
and it should do exactly the right thing.
