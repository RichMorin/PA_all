"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification".
NTP is widely used to synchronize a computer to Internet time servers
or other sources, such as a radio or satellite receiver
or telephone modem service.
It can also be used as a server for dependent clients.
It provides accuracies typically less than a millisecond on LANs
and up to a few milliseconds on WANs.
Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple redundant servers
and diverse network paths in order to achieve high accuracy and reliability.
