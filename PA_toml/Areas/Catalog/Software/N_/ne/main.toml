> ne is a free (GPL'd) text editor based on the POSIX standard
that runs (we hope) on almost any UN*X machine.
ne is easy to use for the beginner, but powerful and fully configurable
for the wizard, and most sparing in its resource usage.
If you have the resources and the patience to use emacs
or the right mental twist to use vi then probably ne is not for you.
However, if you need an editor that:

> - compiles without effort everywhere (or almost everywhere),
  is packaged for all Linux distributions,
  and ported to other operating systems (such as Mac OS X);

> - is fast, small, powerful and simple to use;

> - has standard keystrokes (e.g., copy is CTRL-C);

> - uses little bandwidth, so it is ideal for email,
  editing through phone line (or slow GSM/GPRS/UMTS) connections;

> - has a very compact internal text representation,
  so you can easily load and modify very large files...

> ... then you should try ne.
