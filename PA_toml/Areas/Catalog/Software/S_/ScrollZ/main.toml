> ScrollZ is an advanced IRC client based on ircII.  It incorporates many
useful features found in all sorts of scripts.  The main difference
between these scripts and ScrollZ is the code - whereas ircII scripts
take a lot of disk and memory space and run slow, ScrollZ only takes a
couple of extra kilobytes compared to stock ircII client yet runs faster
than any ircII script.  This was accomplished by using C code instead of
ircII scripting language.  This reduces memory and CPU usage and code
tends to run way faster.
