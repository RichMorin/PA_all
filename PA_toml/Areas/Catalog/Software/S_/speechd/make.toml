Speakup is included in the Raspberry VI distribution.

Speech-dispatcher serves as a go-between between screen readers and
speech synthesizers.  Orca goes through Speech-dispatcher, hence the
need for a speech-dispatcher module for OpenMAX to allow Orca to use it.

Mike Ray hopes to write a speech-dispatcher driver based on his new
`libpiespeak` library.  This could let us avoid using USB audio and
use `speechd.el` to connect Emacspeak to speech-dispatcher.
