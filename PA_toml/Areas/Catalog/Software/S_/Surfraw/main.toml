> Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety
of popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power.
It reclaims google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,
slashdot, and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen lands
of html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in unix heartland,
as god loving extensions to the shell.

> Surfraw abstracts the browser away from input.
Doing so lets it get on with what it's good at. Browsing.
Interpretation of linguistic forms is handed back to the shell,
which is what it, and human beings are good at.
Combined with netscape-remote or incremental text browsers, such as
links (http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mikulas/links/),
w3m (http://www.w3m.org/), and screen(1)
a Surfraw liberateur is capable of navigating speeds
that leave GUI tainted idolaters agape with fear and wonder.
