Speakup is included in the Raspberry VI distribution.

Speakup is a kernel module that provides a text-to-speech interface
at the kernel level.

espeak is a popular software speech synthesizer.

espeak-ng is the next generation version of espeak.

espeakup is a terminal screen reader that utilizes speakup and espeak/espeak-ng.

openMAX is a sound driver that bypasses the broken ALSA implementation
to render sound using the Pi's GPU. This bypasses the faulty code that
causes the stuttering.

piespeakup is a fork of espeakup that utilizes OpenMAX.

Speech-dispatcher serves as a go-between between screen readers and
speech synthesizers.  Orca goes through Speech-dispatcher, hence the
need for a speech-dispatcher module for OpenMAX to allow Orca to use it.
