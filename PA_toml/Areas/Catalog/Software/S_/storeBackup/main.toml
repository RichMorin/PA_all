> Storebackup is a backup suite that stores files on other disks.

> It uses deduplication based optimizations that reduce the disk space needed
and improve performance.
StoreBackup unifies the advantages of traditional full and incremental backups.
It supports fast backup over high latency lines like vpn connections.
It includes tools for analysing backup data and restoring.
Once archived, files are simply accessible by mounting file systems
(eg. locally, via Samba or NFS).

> StoreBackup also supports very efficient backups of big image files
(from eg. TrueCrypt, mbox, Xen, KVM, VMware, etc.)
or complete devices via deduplication.

> It also supports:

> - integrity checks of backups (via md5 sums generated from source)

> - isolated incremental backups without direct access to the repositories (later integration in master backup)

> - time shifted replication of backups to additional other disks / locations ("backup of backups")
