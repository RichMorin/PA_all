> The mblaze message system is a set of Unix utilities to deal with mail
kept in Maildir folders.
It is a classic command line MUA and has no features for receiving
or transferring mail;
you are expected to fetch your mail using fdm(1), getmail(1), offlineimap(1),
procmail(1), or similar, and send it using dma(8), msmtp(1), sendmail(8),
as provided by OpenSMTPD, Postfix, or similar.
mblaze expects your mail to reside in Maildir folders.

Its design is roughly inspired by MH, the RAND Message Handling System,
but it is a complete implementation from scratch.
mblaze operates directly on Maildir folders and doesn't use its own caches
or databases.
There is no setup needed for many uses.
