> mitmproxy is an SSL-capable man-in-the-middle HTTP proxy.
It provides a console interface that allows traffic flows
to be inspected and edited on the fly.

> Also shipped is mitmdump, the command-line version of mitmproxy, 
with the same functionality but without the frills.
Think tcpdump for HTTP.

> Features:

> - intercept and modify HTTP traffic on the fly
> - save HTTP conversations for later replay and analysis
> - replay both HTTP clients and servers
> - make scripted changes to HTTP traffic using Python
> - SSL interception certs generated on the fly
