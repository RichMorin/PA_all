  precis      = 'fast console MPEG audio player and decoder library'

  verbose     = '''
> The mpg123 distribution contains a real time MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 audio
player/decoder for layers 1,2 and 3 (most commonly MPEG 1.0 layer 3 aka MP3),
as well as re-usable decoding and output libraries.
Among others, it works on GNU/Linux, MacOSX, the BSDs, Solaris, AIX, HPUX,
SGI Irix, OS/2, and Cygwin or plain MS Windows
(not all more exotic platforms tested regularly, but patches welcome).
