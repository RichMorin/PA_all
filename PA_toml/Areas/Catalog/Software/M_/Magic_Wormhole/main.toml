> Magic Wormhole provides a command-line tool and Python library
named "wormhole" which makes it possible to very easily transfer short pieces
of text or arbitrary-sized files or directories from one computer to another.

The two endpoints are identified by using identical "wormhole codes":
in general, the sending machine generates and displays the code,
which must then be typed into the receiving machine.
The codes are short and human-pronounceable,
using a phonetically-distinct wordlist.
The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords,
so usually only a few characters must be typed.
Wormhole codes are single-use and do not need to be memorized.
