> With the enormous amounts of e-mail many people gather
and the importance of e-mail messages in our daily work-flow,
it is very important to be able to quickly deal with all that -
in particular, to instantly find that one important e-mail you need right now.

> For that, mu was created.
mu is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the Maildir-format,
on Unix-like systems.
mu’s main purpose is to help you to find the messages you need, quickly;
in addition, it allows you to view messages, extract attachments,
create new maildirs, ...
See the mu cheatsheet for some examples.
Mu’s source code is available in github,
and there is the mu-discuss mailing list.

mu includes an emacs-based e-mail client (mu4e), a simple GUI (mug),
and bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language.
