> Yasr is a general-purpose console screen reader for GNU/Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems.  The name "yasr" is an acronym that can
stand for either "Yet Another Screen Reader" or "Your All-purpose Screen
Reader" (take your pick; it doesn't really matter much).

> It supports a number of synthesizers, although interfacing issues exist
with some of them at the moment.  Currently, yasr attempts to support the
Speak-out, DEC-talk, BNS, Apollo, and DoubleTalk.  It is also able to
communicate with Emacspeak servers and can thus be used with synthesizers
not directly supported, such as Festival Lite (via eflite) or FreeTTS.

> It is small enough to fit on a root disk if necessary (provided an
Emacspeak server is not needed, of course). It is written in C and works
by opening a pseudo-terminal and running a shell, intercepting all input
and output.  It looks at the escape sequences being sent and maintains a
virtual "window" containing what it believes to be on the screen.  It
thus does not use any features specific to Linux and can be ported to
other Unix-like operating systems without too much trouble.  The current
version should also run under FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris (thanks to
Rich Burridge for the Solaris port).
