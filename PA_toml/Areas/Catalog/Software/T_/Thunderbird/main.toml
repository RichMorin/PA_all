> Thunderbird is an email client suitable for free distribution.
The goal of Thunderbird is to produce a cross platform, stand-alone,
mail application using the XUL user interface language.
It supports different mail accounts, no matter of the used protocol
like POP(s) or IMAP(s), has an integrated learning spam filter,
and offers easy organization of mails with tagging and virtual folders.
Also, more features can be added by installing extensions.
