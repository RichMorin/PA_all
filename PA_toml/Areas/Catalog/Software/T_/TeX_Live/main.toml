> TeX Live is an easy (we hope) way to get up and running
with the TeX document production system.
It provides a comprehensive TeX system with binaries
for most flavors of Unix, including GNU/Linux, macOS, and also Windows.
It includes all the major TeX-related programs, macro packages,
and fonts that are free software,
including support for many languages around the world.
Many operating systems provide it via their own distributions.
