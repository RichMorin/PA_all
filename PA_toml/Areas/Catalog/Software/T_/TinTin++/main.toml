> TinTin++ (aka tt++) is a Mud client for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS,
and Windows.
TinTin++ can be accessed remotely on an SSH shell account as well. ...

> While TinTin++ is primarily a MUD client, it can be used
as a Unix shell command language, multiplexer/demultiplexer, and automator.
Most console programs (including bash) can be launched from within the client,
allowing you to create highlights, substitions, triggers, timers, aliases,
divert text to different subwindows, combine multiple streams into one, etc.
This allows you to modify the appearance, interface, and behavior
of most console applications.

> Protocols supported by TinTin++ are MCCP (Mud Client Compression Protocol),
MMCP (Mud Master Chat Protocol), xterm 256 colors, truecolors,
and most TELNET options used by MUDs.
Being a console client, TinTin++ works with most screen readers,
and its accessible non graphical command interface makes the client
particularly screen reader / blind friendly.
