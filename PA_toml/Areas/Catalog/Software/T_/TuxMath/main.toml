> In "Tux, of Math Command," you play the part of Commander Tux,
as he defends his friends from an attack of math equations.
Comets are crashing towards the friendly penguins in their igloos,
and you must destroy the comets by solving their equations.

As of version 1.7.0, TuxMath also includes a completely new game activity,
"Factoroids", which gives practice in factoring numbers
and simplifying fractions, as well as zapping rocks floating through space.
