  verbose     = '''
> Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a very powerful
but easy to learn dynamic programming language,
suitable for a very wide range of uses, including web and desktop applications,
networking, administration, testing and many more.
Open source and business-friendly, Tcl is a mature yet evolving language
that is truly cross platform, easily deployed and highly extensible.

> Tk is a graphical user interface toolkit that takes developing desktop applications to a higher level than conventional approaches.
Tk is the standard GUI not only for Tcl, but for many other dynamic languages,
and can produce rich, native applications that run unchanged
across Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and more.
