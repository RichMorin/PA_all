> This is TalkingArch, a re-spin of the Arch Linux live ISO, modified to
include speech and braille output for blind and visually impaired users.
Arch Linux is designed to be simple, lightweight and flexible.  TalkingArch
retains all the features of the Arch Linux live image, but adds speech and
braille packages to make it possible for blind and visually impaired users
to install Arch Linux eyes-free.

> Feel free to visit our download page to grab the latest build of the ISO
image, which will happily run from either a DVD or from a USB stick.
Instructions for writing the image can be found at the CD Burning and
USB Installation Media pages at the Arch Wiki.  Also, specific instructions
for installing Arch Linux using the TalkingArch live media can be found
at the TalkingArch wiki page.
