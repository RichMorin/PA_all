> In Fish Cascade you control Tux as he searches for fish to eat.
Fish fall from the top of the screen.
These fish have letters on them.
Unforunately for Tux, eating a fish with a letter on it
will cause his stomach to become ill, so it is up to you to help Tux eat fish!
By typing the letters, it will cause them to disappear
so tux can chow down on the  fish.

In Comet Zap you control Tux as he defends the cities from comets.
To protect a city from a comet, type the letter on the comet
and it will cause Tux to destroy it with a laser!
(In case you wondered, Comet Zap is an adaptation
of the *great* math drill game, "Tux, of Math Command").

"Lessons" and "Phrase Typing" are additional typing activities.

"Phrase Typing" involves typing of phrases or complete sentences,
with  measurment of accuracy and typing speed.
The current phrases in the default (English) theme
are a collection of pangrams (sentences with all 26 letters),
as well as some well-known quotes from public domain literature.
At some point we will make this easy for teachers to modify,
so sentences related to a current study topic might be used.
