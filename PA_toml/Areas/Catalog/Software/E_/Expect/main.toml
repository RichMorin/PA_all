Expect really makes this stuff trivial.
Expect is also useful for testing these same applications.
And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in X11 GUIs.

> Expect can make easy all sorts of tasks
that are prohibitively difficult with anything else.
You will find that Expect is an absolutely invaluable tool -
using it, you will be able to automate tasks
that you've never even thought of before -
and you'll be able to do this automation quickly and easily.
