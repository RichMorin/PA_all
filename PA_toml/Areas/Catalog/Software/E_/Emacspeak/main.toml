  verbose     = '''
> Emacspeak is a free computer application, a speech interface, and an audio
desktop (as opposed to a screen reader). ... It is tightly integrated with
Emacs, allowing it to render intelligible and useful content rather than
parsing the graphics (hence it is sometimes referred to not as a separate
program, but a subsystem of Emacs proper); ... Emacspeak is one of the most
popular speech interfaces for Linux, bundled with most major distributions.
