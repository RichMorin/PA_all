Emacspeak is not included in the Ubuntu distribution.  The apt-get version
of Emacspeak was dated, so Amanda downloaded the source code and built a
copy from that.

Under Debian's Jessie release (including derivatives such as Raspbian and
Ubuntu), Emacspeak relies on the espeak server.  It also requires the line
"export DTK_PROGRAM=espeak" in the ~/.bashrc file.

Mike Ray says that the version in Raspberry VI stutters badly, it's
probably not usable until he finishes the server.  He also says:

If you are running Arch Linux, the recommended way to run Emacspeak is to
put it somewhere like "/usr/local/share/emacspeak" and then load it via
your .emacs.d directory.  (I can provide a usable .emacs.d/ directory and
the files below that path if necessary.)

Also, if you want the auditory icons, which are fun, you will need to
install mplayer.  Or maybe that is for the start-up music, I forget.

Emacspeak starts by playing a bit of Bach and then says "all my circuits
are working perfectly" etc.

Rill is the list Emacspeak expert.


Amanda had a problem on Ubuntu with Emacspeak being silent.  She says:
"I fixed it by installing tclx. The command tcl doesn't work when I test
the espeak server but tclx now does."
