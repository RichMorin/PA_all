  verbose     = '''
> Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language
that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM).
Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions
for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications.
Elixir also provides productive tooling and an extensible design.
The latter is supported by compile-time metaprogramming with macros
and polymorphism via protocols.
