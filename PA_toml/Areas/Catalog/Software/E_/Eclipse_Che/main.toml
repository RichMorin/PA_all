> Eclipse Che is an open-source, Java based developer workspace server
and cloud integrated development environment (IDE).
It includes a multi-user remote development platform.
The workspace server comes with a flexible RESTful webservice.
It also contains a SDK for creating plug-ins for languages, frameworks,
or tools.
The main difference between Eclipse Che and the standard Eclipse IDE
is its ability to create Docker containers to execute applications.
Eclipse Che is an Eclipse Cloud Development (ECD) top-level project,
allowing contributions from the user community.
