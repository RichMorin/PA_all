> An 'ID database' is a binary file containing a list of file names,
a list of tokens,
and a sparse matrix indicating which tokens appear in which files.

> With this database and some tools to query it,
many text-searching tasks become simpler and faster.
For example, you can list all files that
reference a particular `#include` file throughout a huge source hierarchy,
search for all the memos containing references to a project,
or automatically invoke an editor on all files containing references
to some function or variable.
Anyone with a large software project to maintain,
or a large set of text files to organize, can benefit from the ID utilities.

> Although the name `ID` is short for "identifier",
the ID utilities handle more than just identifiers;
they also treat other kinds of tokens, most notably numeric constants,
and the contents of certain character strings.
