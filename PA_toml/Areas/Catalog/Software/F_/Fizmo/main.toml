> Fizmo provides a Z-Machine interpreter development library in plain C
along with ncurses-, SDL2- and console-based frontends, supporting
Z-Machine versions 1 to 5, 7, and 8.

> That means it allows you to play interactive fiction, also known as
text adventures, which were implemented either by Infocom or created
using the Inform compiler on a terminal, or to develop your own
interactive fiction front end in C or any C-related language like C++
or Objective-C.
