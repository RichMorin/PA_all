> F123 Access (pronounced "F 1 2 3 Access") is software which reformats
website pages so that these pages are more accessible to blind people.
F123 Access is a web-browser "extension" which is installed in your
Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome browser.

> F123 Access improves the formatting of pages for those with a visual
impairment who use screen-reader software.

> F123 Access is compatible with a wide variety of screen-readers,
including JAWS, NVDA, Orca, VoiceOver, and Window Eyes.  The current
version is designed for use with the Mozilla Firefox and Chrome browsers,
although we hope to start work on a Microsoft Edge version soon.
