# I sent email to F123:
#   I'm interested in building F123 Access into a Debian-based Docker container.
#   Does this sound like a plausible effort?  Is the source code downloadable?  
#
# and got this response:
#   Thanks for your message. At this moment this is not possible, as F123Access
#   has many elements which are not open source.  However, I will share your
#   e-mail with the developer, just in case things have changed.
