> RipIT is used to create MPEG-1 Layer 3 (mp3) using Lame, or uses Flac (flac),
Ogg Vorbis (ogg), Faac (m4a), Musepack (mpc), mp4als (als), Wavpack (wv),
or ffmpeg to convert audio files (wav) extracted from an audio CD.
It is a console based front-end (no GUI here), written in Perl,
for these programs (which must be installed --
at least one out of each category):

> - dagrab, cdparanoia or cdda2wav (tosha and cdd are also supported)
  for ripping the audio CD tracks

> - Lame, OggVorbis, Flac or Faac, Musepack, mp4als, Wavpack or ffmpeg
  for encoding the wav files to a compressed format (find some info and links)

> - CDDB_get 2.27 or higher, a Perl module for CDDB retrieval (info and links).

> - LWP::simple, a Perl module to access web pages and eventually Digest::MD5
  and Unicode::UCD depending on your choice of options.
  When using Musicbrainz DB, one needs additionally:
  WebService::MusicBrainz and the discid-tool or MusicBrainz::DiscID.

> The program will do the following without user intervention:

> - getting the audio CD Album/Artist/Tracks information from MusicBrainz
  or freeCDDB,

> - ripping the audio CD Tracks,

> - encoding to Flac, mp3, Ogg-Vorbis, mpc, m4a or als,

> - id3 tags encoded songs,

> - creating an playlist (m3u) file,

> - optionally generating a toc or inf files for DAO burning with, CD-text

> - optionally preparing and send a CDDB submission and save it locally,

> - optionally extracting hidden songs and split ghost songs,

> - optionally creating md5sum files for all tracks,

> - running several encoder processes at the same time and same run.
