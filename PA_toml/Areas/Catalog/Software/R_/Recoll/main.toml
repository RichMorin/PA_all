> Recoll finds documents based on their contents as well as their file names.

> - Versions are available for Linux, MS Windows and Mac OS X.

> - It can search most document formats.
  You may need external applications for text extraction.

> - It can reach any storage place: files, archive members, email attachments,
  transparently handling decompression.

> - One click will open the document inside a native editor
  or display an even quicker text preview.

> - A WEB front-end with preview and download features
  can replace or supplement the GUI for remote use.
  
> - The software is free, open source, and licensed under the GPL.

> - Detailed features and application requirements for supported document types.

> Recoll will index an MS-Word document stored as an attachment
to an e-mail message inside a Thunderbird folder archived in a Zip file
(and more...).
It will also help you search for it with a friendly and powerful interface,
and let you open a copy of a PDF at the right page with two clicks.
There is little that will remain hidden on your disk.
