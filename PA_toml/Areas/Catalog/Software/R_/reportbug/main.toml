> reportbug is a tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian and
derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:

> - Integration with mutt and mh/nmh mail readers.
> - Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
>   whether problems have already been reported.
> - Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
> - Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
> - Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
> - Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.

> reportbug is designed to be used on systems with an installed mail
transport agent, like exim or sendmail; however, you can edit the
configuration file and send reports using any available mail server.

> This package also includes the "querybts" script for browsing the Debian
bug tracking system.
