Raspbian is the Raspberry Pi Foundationâ€™s official supported operating system.
Raspbian Lite is the base for the Raspberry VI distribution.

> The lite version of Raspbian Jessie is just like the normal Raspbian
Jessie operating system but without any of the graphical desktop
environment packages.  This means it's much, much smaller than the
normal image -- it's only about 1.3 gigabytes in size vs. over 4
gigabytes for the normal image!
