> Ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library dependencies,
no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no rodent dependence.
It is largely modelled after GNU Screen,
which has done wonders in the virtual terminal market.

> The screen can be split into non-overlapping frames.
All windows are kept maximized inside their frames
to take full advantage of your precious screen real estate.

> All interaction with the window manager is done through keystrokes.
ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key clobbering
that cripples Emacs and other quality pieces of software.
