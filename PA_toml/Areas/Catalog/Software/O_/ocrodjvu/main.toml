> Ocrodjvu is a wrapper around the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems
Cuneiform, Gocr, Ocrad, OCRopus, and (standalone) Tesseract.
It is designed for OCR on documents in DjVu format,
which is especially suited for high-quality archiving of books.

> After processing, the DjVu document embeds a text layer.
Other programs can then be used to read the document,
search it for specific terms, print it out, or use the information
in the OCR layer as a way to improve the document's accessibility.
