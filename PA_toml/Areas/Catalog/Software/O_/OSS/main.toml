> Open Sound System is an audio subsystem that provides a cross platform API
and device drivers for most consumer and professional audio devices
for UNIX and POSIX based operating systems, including Linux.
Owing to its open architecture,
applications developed on one supporting operating system platform
can be easily recompiled on any other platform.

> Open Sound System on Solaris supports x86, AMD64, and Sparc processors.
It also provides support for the Solaris Audio API
(SADA or commonly known as devaudio).
SADA applications will transparently run on top of Open Sound System drivers
and will co-exist with OSS API compatible applications.

*Note:*
OSS has been supplanted by [ALSA]{cat_sof|ALSA} on most Linux distributions.
