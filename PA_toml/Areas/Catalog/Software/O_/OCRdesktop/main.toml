> OCRdesktop is a useful accessibility tool to grab content from the screen
as text via OCR technology.

> It takes an image of the current window or workspace,
prepares it for better results, and uses tesseract to recognize text on it.
The result is presented in a caret-enabled text area,
in a detailed list with coordinates and confidence, or in the clipboard.
It also can emulate clicks on the text.
