> OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models.
It is free software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X.
Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender),
it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling
but instead on the CAD aspects.
Thus it might be the application you are looking for
when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts
but pretty sure is not what you are looking for
when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies.

> OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller.
Instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file
that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file.
This gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process
and enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process
or make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.
