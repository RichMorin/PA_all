This section includes information on computer software.
At present, most of the items are of particular relevance
to blind and visually impaired users.
In particular, we are collecting candidates for inclusion in
[Perkian]{con_ove|Perkian_Intro}, a "batteries included",
blind-friendly [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux} distribution
and [Perkify]{con_ove|Perkify_Intro}
(Perkian on a [virtual machine]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine}).
However, we'd love to have entries in other areas!
