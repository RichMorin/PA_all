> This program includes both 'diction' and 'style'.
'Diction' identifies wordy and commonly misused phrases;
'style' analyzes surface characteristics of a document,
including sentence length and other readability measures.
While these programs cannot help you structure a document well,
they can help to avoid poor wording and compare the readability
of your document with others.
Both commands support English and German documents.
