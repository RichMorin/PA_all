> Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface,
driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.
Dasher is a competitive text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard
cannot be used - for example,

> - when operating a computer one-handed,
by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse;

> - when operating a computer with zero hands
(i.e., by head-mouse or by eyetracker);

> - on a palmtop computer;

> - on a wearable computer.

> The eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user
to write text as fast as normal handwriting - 29 words per minute;
using a mouse, experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.
Dasher can be used to write efficiently in any language.
