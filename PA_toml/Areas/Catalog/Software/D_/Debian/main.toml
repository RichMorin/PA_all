> Debian was begun in August 1993 by Ian Murdock, as a new distribution
which would be made openly, in the spirit of Linux and GNU.
Debian was meant to be carefully and conscientiously put together,
and to be maintained and supported with similar care.
It started as a small, tightly-knit group of Free Software hackers,
and gradually grew to become a large, well-organized community
of developers and users. See the detailed history.

> Since many people have asked, Debian is pronounced /ˈde.bi.ən/.
It comes from the names of the creator of Debian, Ian Murdock,
and his wife, Debra.
