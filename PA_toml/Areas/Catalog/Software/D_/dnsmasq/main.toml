> Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure, DNS forwarder and DHCP
server.  It is designed to provide DNS and optionally, DHCP, to a small
network.  It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the
global DNS.  The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows
machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names
configured either in each host or in a central configuration file.
Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP for
network booting of diskless machines.
