There’s not much here that differentiates it from any
of the existing Markdown implementations except that it’s written in C
instead of one of the vast flock of scripting languages
that are fighting it out for the Perl crown.

> Markdown provides a library that gives you formatting functions
suitable for marking down entire documents or lines of text,
a command-line program that you can use to mark down documents
interactively or from a script, and a tiny (3 programs so far) suite
of example programs that show how to fully utilize the markdown library.

> My markdown also does, by default, various
[smartypants]{https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants}-style
substitutions.
