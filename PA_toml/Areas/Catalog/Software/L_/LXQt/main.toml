> LXQt is a lightweight Qt desktop environment.

> It will not get in your way.
It will not hang or slow down your system.
It is focused on being a classic desktop with a modern look and feel.

> LXQt has already been included in most Linux and BSD distributions
so you may just try it out on your regular system or in a VM.
