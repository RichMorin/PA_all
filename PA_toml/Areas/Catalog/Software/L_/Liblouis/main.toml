> The Liblouis software suite provides an open-source braille translator,
back-translator, and formatter for a large number of languages and braille codes.
It is a set of libraries designed for use in any of a number of applications,
both free and commercial.
It is written in C so that it does not require a runtime environment
and hence can be used in applications written in high-level languages
such as Java and Python.
