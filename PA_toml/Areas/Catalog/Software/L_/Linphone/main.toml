> Linphone is an open source instant messaging and
voice/video over IP (VoIP) phone that makes it possible
to communicate freely with people over the internet
via voice, video and text messaging.

Since it follows open standards from the telecommunications industry
(SIP, RTP), Linphone is interoperable with most PBXs and SIP servers,
including our own Flexisip server, and can be used with any SIP VoIP operator.
