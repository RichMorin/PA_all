> LXTerminal is a VTE-based terminal emulator
for the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment (LXDE).

It supports multiple tabs and has only minimal dependencies,
thus being completely desktop-independent.
In order to reduce memory usage and increase the performance,
all instances of the terminal are sharing a single process.
