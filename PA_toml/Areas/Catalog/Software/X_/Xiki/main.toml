> Xiki strives to be the simplest possible way (and ways) to create
interactive interfaces.  This means a text in and text out interface.
Since everything is text, almost nothing is against the rules when
you're creating an interface in Xiki.  Xiki stands for "expanding wiki",
and is inspired by the wiki philosophy of fully editable text, with
simple syntaxes (like ">" for a heading, and "-" for a bullet).  Xiki
extends wiki ideas to user interface in general.
