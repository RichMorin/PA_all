> Xarchiver is the ultimate solution for handling archives on Linux and FreeBSD.
It's a Desktop Environment independent archiver front end.
All common archive formats are supported;
deb and RPM packages are handled without their package managers being installed.
Xarchiver only depends on the GTK+ libraries and
utilizes various (un)compressor/(un)archiver command line programs at runtime.
Installation of xdg-utils is optional, but installing it will allow Xarchiver
to support opening more file types directly from inside an archive.
