> Originally, hostapd was an optional user space component for Host AP
driver.  It adds more features to the basic IEEE 802.11 management
included in the kernel driver: using external RADIUS authentication
server for MAC address based access control, IEEE 802.1X Authenticator
and dynamic WEP keying, RADIUS accounting, WPA/WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i/RSN)
Authenticator and dynamic TKIP/CCMP keying.

> The current version includes support for other drivers, an integrated
EAP authenticator (i.e., allow full authentication without requiring
an external RADIUS authentication server), and RADIUS authentication
server for EAP authentication.
