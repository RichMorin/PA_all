> Joe, the Joe's Own Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors:
the key sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors,
but the feature set is much larger than of those.
Joe has all of the features a Unix user should expect:
full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix integration,
a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search system.
It also has six help reference cards which are always available,
and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface.
