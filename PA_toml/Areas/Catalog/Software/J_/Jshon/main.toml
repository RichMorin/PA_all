> Jshon parses, reads, and creates JSON.
It is designed to be as usable as possible from within the shell
and replaces fragile adhoc parsers made from grep/sed/awk
as well as heavyweight one-line parsers made from perl/python. ...

> Jshon loads json text from stdin, performs actions,
then displays the last action on stdout.
Some of the options output json, others output plain text meta information.
Because Bash has very poor nested data structures,
Jshon does not try to return a native bash data structure
as a typical library would.
Instead, Jshon provides a history stack containing all the manipulations.
