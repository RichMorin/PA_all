> Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive
computational environment for creating Jupyter notebook documents.
The "notebook" term can colloquially make reference to many different entities,
mainly the Jupyter web application, Jupyter Python web server, or Jupyter
document format depending on context.
A Jupyter Notebook document is a JSON document, following a versioned schema,
and containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code,
text (using Markdown), mathematics, plots and rich media,
usually ending with the ".ipynb" extension.

> A Jupyter Notebook can be converted to a number of open standard output
formats (HTML, presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown,
Python) through "Download As" in the web interface, via the nbconvert library
or "jupyter nbconvert" command line interface in a shell.
