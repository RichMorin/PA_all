> Have you ever wanted to take the audio output of one piece of software
and send it to another?
How about taking the output of that same program and send it to two others,
then record the result in the first program?
Or maybe you’re a programmer who writes real-time audio and music applications
and who is looking for a cross-platform API that enables
not only device sharing but also inter-application audio routing,
and is incredibly easy to learn and use?
If so, JACK may be what you’ve been looking for.
