> GNU a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter.
Of course it processes plain text files,
but [it] also pretty prints quite a few popular languages.
Its slogan is precisely "Do The Right Thing",
which means that though it is highly configurable,
everything was made so that a novice user
can do complicated PostScript manipulations.
For instance, it has the ability to delegate the processing of some files
to other filters (such as groff, texi2dvi, dvips, gzip, etc.),
[which] allows a uniform treatment (n-up, page selection, duplex etc.)
of heterogeneous files.
