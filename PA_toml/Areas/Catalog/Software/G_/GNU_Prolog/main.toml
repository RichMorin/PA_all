> GNU Prolog is a free Prolog compiler
with constraint solving over finite domains.
GNU Prolog accepts a Prolog+constraint program and produces a native binary
(like gcc does from a C source).
The obtained executable is then stand-alone.
The size of this executable can be quite small since GNU Prolog can avoid
 linking the code of most unused built-in predicates.
The performance of GNU Prolog is very encouraging
(comparable to commercial systems).
Beside the native-code compilation,
GNU Prolog offers a classical interactive interpreter (top-level).

> The Prolog part conforms to the ISO standard for Prolog
with many extensions that are very useful in practice
(global variables, OS interface, sockets, ...).

> GNU Prolog also includes an efficient constraint solver
over Finite Domains (FD).
This opens contraint logic pogramming to the user combining the power
of constraint programming to the declarativity of logic programming.

> More information about GNU Prolog can be found at the
[GNU Prolog web site]{http://www.gprolog.org}.
