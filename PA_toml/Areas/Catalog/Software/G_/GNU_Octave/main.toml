  verbose     = '''
> GNU Octave is a high-level language,
primarily intended for numerical computations.
It provides a convenient command line interface
for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically,
and for performing other numerical experiments
using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab.
It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.

> Octave has extensive tools
for solving common numerical linear algebra problems,
finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions,
manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential
and differential-algebraic equations.
It is easily extensible and customizable
via user-defined functions written in Octaveâ€™s own language,
or using dynamically loaded modules
written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.
