> GNOME ... is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix-like
operating systems.
GNOME was originally an acronym for GNU Network Object Model Environment,
but the acronym was dropped because it no longer reflected the vision
of the GNOME project.

> GNOME aims to make and keep the desktop environment physically
and cognitively ergonomic for people with disabilities.
The GNOME HIG tries to take this into account as far as possible
but specific issues are solved by special software.

> GNOME addresses computer accessibility issues by using
the Accessibility Toolkit (ATK) application programming interface,
which allows enhancing user experience by using special input methods
and speech synthesis and speech recognition software.
Particular utilities are registered with ATK using Assistive Technology
Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI), and become globally used
throughout the desktop.
Several assistive technology providers, including Orca screen reader
and Dasher input method, were developed specifically for use with GNOME.
