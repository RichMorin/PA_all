> GIMP is an advanced picture editor.
You can use it to edit, enhance, and retouch photos and scans, create drawings,
and make your own images.
It has a large collection of professional-level editing tools and filters,
similar to the ones you might find in Photoshop.
Numerous fine-control settings and features like layers, paths, masks,
and scripting give you total control over your images.

> Many image file formats are supported, including JPEG, Photoshop (.psd),
and Paint Shop Pro (.psp) files.
It can also be used to scan and print photos.
