> R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment
which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent
Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues.
R can be considered as a different implementation of S.
There are some important differences,
but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

> R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling,
classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
The S language is often the vehicle of choice
for research in statistical methodology,
and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.

> One of Râ€™s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality
plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed.
Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices
in graphics, but the user retains full control.
