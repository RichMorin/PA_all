> GNU gcal is a command line program for calculation and display calendars.
This is an implementation of the UNIX cal command developed in 1994
by Thomas Esken, then maintained for the GNU project by Giuseppe Scrivano.

> Gcal, the GNU Gregorian calendar program,
displays hybrid and proleptic Julian and Gregorian calendar sheets, respectively, for one month, three months or a whole year.
It also displays eternal holiday lists for many countries around the globe
and provides very powerful methods to create fixed date lists
that can be used for reminding purposes.

> Gcal can calculate various astronomical data and times of the Sun and the Moon
for at pleasure any location; precisely enough for most civil purposes.
It further contains a META-TEXT interface that creates input
for formatting or displaying systems -- such as LaTeX,
or WWW browser programs that visualize HTML.
Gcal supports some other calendar systems, for example
the Chinese and Japanese calendar, the Hebrew calendar,
the civil Islamic calendar, too.
