> Mailutils is a swiss army knife of electronic mail handling.
It offers a rich set of utilities and daemons for processing e-mail.

> All Mailutils programs are able to operate on mailboxes
of any existing format, ranging from standard UNIX maildrops, through maildir,
and up to remote mailboxes, which are transparently accessed
using IMAP4, POP3, and SMTP.

> Mailutils is oriented toward three kinds of audiences: regular users,
system administrators, and developers of email-handling software.

> *Regular users* will find here an implementation
of the traditional UNIX mail reader `mail`,
command line utilities such as `frm`, `messages`, `readmsg`,
and `sieve` -- a flexible utility for filtering the incoming mail.

> A special feature of Mailutils is an implementation
of the MH Message Handling System, which combines a power of the UNIX philosophy
with a flexibility of Mailutils libraries,
thus allowing to easily incorporate mail from remote mailboxes.

> For *system administrators*, Mailutils provides a set of daemons
for delivering and reading electronic mail, including `pop3d`, `imap4d`,
and a universal mail delivery agent, called `maidag`.

> Some utilities are of equal interest for both audiences.
One of them is `movemail`, which owes its name to a program from the
GNU Emacs distribution, but provides a much richer set of possibilities
than its predecessor.
The Mailutils `movemail` is a full-fledged mail retrieval agent
which can easily be used to fetch mail from remote servers.
At the same time, it is also a multi-purpose tool for converting mail storages
between various mailbox formats,
which will be of particular interest for system administrators.

> Finally, for *software developers*,
Mailutils offers a set of libraries for doing almost any mail-related task
on any existing mailbox format, and all that using a consistent,
format-independent, interface.
