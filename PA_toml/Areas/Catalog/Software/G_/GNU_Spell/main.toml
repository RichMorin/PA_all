> A spell checking program which prints each misspelled word
on a line of its own.
It is designed as a clone of the standard Unix 'spell' program,
and implemented as a wrapper for 'GNU aspell' and 'ispell'.
Spell accepts its arguments as a list of files to read from.
Within that list, the magical file name "-" causes spell
to read from the standard input.
In addition, when called with no file name arguments,
Spell assumes that it should process standard input.
