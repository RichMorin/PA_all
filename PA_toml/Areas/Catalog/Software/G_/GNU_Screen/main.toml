  verbose     = '''
> GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer, a software application that can be
used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access
multiple separate login sessions inside a single terminal window, or
detach and reattach sessions from a terminal.  It is useful for dealing
with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating
programs from the session of the Unix shell that started the program,
particularly so a remote process continues running even when the user is
disconnected.
