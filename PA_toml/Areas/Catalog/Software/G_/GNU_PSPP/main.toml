> GNU PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data.
It is a free as in freedom replacement for the proprietary program SPSS,
and appears very similar to it with a few exceptions.

> The most important of these exceptions are, that there are no “time bombs”;
your copy of PSPP will not “expire” or deliberately stop working in the future.
Neither are there any artificial limits on the number of cases or variables
which you can use.
There are no additional packages to purchase
in order to get “advanced” functions;
all functionality that PSPP currently supports is in the core package.

> PSPP is a stable and reliable application.
It can perform descriptive statistics, T-tests, anova,
linear and logistic regression, measures of association, cluster analysis,
reliability and factor analysis, non-parametric tests and more.
Its backend is designed to perform its analyses as fast as possible,
regardless of the size of the input data.
You can use PSPP with its graphical interface
or the more traditional syntax commands.
