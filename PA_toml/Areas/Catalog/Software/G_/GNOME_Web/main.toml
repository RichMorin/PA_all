  precis      = 'a lightweight web browser for GNOME'

  verbose     = '''
> GNOME Web (originally called Epiphany until 2012)
is a free and open-source lightweight web browser developed by GNOME only
for Linux and Unix-like systems.

> The browser was forked from Galeon, after developers' disagreements
about Galeon's growing complexity.
Since then Web has been developed as part of the GNOME project
and uses most of GNOME's technology and settings when applicable.
It is part of the GNOME Core Applications.
As required by the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG),
Web maintains a clean and simple graphical user interface
with only a required minimum number of features exposed to users by default.
The browser's functionality and configurability can be extended
with official and third-party extensions.
