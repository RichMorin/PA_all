> GNU Typist (also called gtypist) is a universal typing tutor.
You can learn correct typing and improve your skills
by practising its exercises on a regular basis.
Its main features are:

> It is free software released under the GNU General Public License.
In addition, it is an official program of the GNU project.

> It comes with several typing tutorials: in Czech, English (QWERTY, Dvorak,
and Colemak keyboards), Russian and Spanish,
as well as simpler exercises in German, French, and Norwegian.

> It interprets a simple and intuitive scripting language
that describes typing tutorials.
You can easily modify existing tutorials or create new ones
according to your needs.

> It supports internationalization and already has an interface
in Czech, English, Finnish, French, German, and Spanish.

> Users can navigate through lessons through an easy to use
arrow-key based menu interface.
'vi' up, down, left and right keys can be used too!

> Thanks to its execution in text mode with the curses library,
it can be compiled and used on several operating systems,
in particular on GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd, on several variants of Unix,
as well as on Windows with the PDCurses library and MinGW.
