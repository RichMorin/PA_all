> GNU Ocrad is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program
based on a feature extraction method.
It reads images in pbm (bitmap), pgm (greyscale) or ppm (color) formats
and produces text in byte (8-bit) or UTF-8 formats.

> Also includes a layout analyser able to separate the columns
or blocks of text normally found on printed pages.

> Ocrad can be used as a stand-alone console application
or as a backend to other programs.
