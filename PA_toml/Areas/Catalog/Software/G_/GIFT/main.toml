> The GIFT (the GNU Image-Finding Tool) is a Content Based Image Retrieval
System (CBIRS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBIR).
It enables you to do Query By Example (QBE: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBE)
on images,
giving you the opportunity to improve query results by relevance feedback.
For processing your queries, the program relies entirely on the content
of the images, freeing you from the need to annotate all images
before querying the collection.

> The GIFT comes with a tool which lets you index whole directory trees
containing images in one go.
You then can use the GIFT server and its client,
to browse your own image collections.

> The GIFT is an open framework for content-based image retrieval.
We explicitly have taken into account the possibility of adding new ways
of querying to the framework.
Our communication protocol for client-server communication, MRML,
is XML based and fully documented (http://www.mrml.net).
This aims at promoting code reuse among researchers and application developers.
Inquiries about APIs and how to integrate new clients/servers into the framework
are welcome (send questions to http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gift
or the maintainer mailto:juri@solarnetone.org).

> The current version of the GIFT can be seen in action
at http://gift.faikvm.com/.
The image database was seeded from Openclipart.

> The latest version can be found and downloaded at ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gift

> The GIFT (ex Viper) is the result of a research effort at the Vision Group
at the CUI (computer science center) of the University of Geneva (see
http://vision.unige.ch/).
This cutting-edge research has been the subject of several publications and
conference talks.
Details can be found at http://viper.unige.ch/.
