> The GNU plotutils package contains software
for both programmers and technical users.
Its centerpiece is libplot, a powerful C/C++ function library
for exporting 2-D vector graphics in many file formats, both vector and bitmap.
On the X Window System, it can also do 2-D vector graphics animations.

> libplot is device-independent, in the sense that its API (application
programming interface) does not depend on the type of graphics file to be
exported.
A PostScript-like API is used both for file export and for graphics animations.
A libplot programmer needs to learn only one API:
not the details of many graphics file formats.

> The package also contains command-line programs for plotting scientific data,
such as GNU graph for XY plotting.
Many of them use libplot to export graphics.
So, they can export graphics in any of libplot's supported formats, such as

> - SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics format),
the XML-based format for Web graphics,
which is standardized by the W3 Consortium.

> - PNG, the open format for bitmap graphics.
(Whenever a bitmap output format is being generated,
libplot converts PostScript-style paths to bitmaps.)

> - The format used by the free xfig drawing editor.
(Edit a 2-D drawing with a mouse, after generating it programmatically!)
PostScript itself.
