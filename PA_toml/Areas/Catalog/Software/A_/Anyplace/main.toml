> People do most of their activities, business, commerce, entertainment,
and socializing indoors.
As all of these are increasingly aided by online services and indoor spaces
are becoming bigger and more complex,
there is a growing need for cost-effective indoor localization, mapping,
navigation, and information services.
In this paper, we present a complete Indoor Information Service,
coined Anyplace, which has an open, modular, extensible,
and scalable architecture, making it ideal for a wide range of applications.

> Our service features three highly desirable properties, namely
crowdsourcing, scalability, and accuracy.
Anyplace implements a set of crowdsourcing-supportive mechanisms
to handle the enormous amount of crowd-sensed data,
filter incorrect user contributions, and exploit Wi-Fi data
from heterogeneous mobile devices.
Moreover, it uses a big-data architecture
for efficient storage and retrieval of localization and mapping data.
Finally, our service relies on the abundance of sensory data on smartphones
(e.g., Wi-Fi signal strength and inertial measurements)
to deliver reliable indoor geolocation information...
