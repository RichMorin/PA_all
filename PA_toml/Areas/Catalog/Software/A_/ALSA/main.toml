> The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) provides audio and MIDI
functionality to the Linux operating system.
ALSA has the following significant features:

> - Efficient support for all types of audio interfaces,
from consumer sound cards to professional multichannel audio interfaces.

> - Fully modularized sound drivers.

> - SMP and thread-safe design (PLEASE READ THIS).

> - User space library (alsa-lib) to simplify application programming
and provide higher level functionality.

> - Support for the older Open Sound System (OSS) API,
providing binary compatibility for most OSS programs.
