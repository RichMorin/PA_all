> Aptitude is an Ncurses and command-line based front-end
to numerous APT libraries, which are also used by APT,
the default Debian package manager.
Aptitude is text based and run from a terminal.

> Aptitude has a number of useful features, including:

> - a mutt-like syntax for matching packages in a flexible manner

> - mark packages as "automatically installed" or "manually installed"
so that packages can be auto-removed when no longer required
(feature available in APT, too, since quite a few Debian release)

> - preview of actions about to be taken
with different colors marking different actions

> - persistence of user actions (similar to dselect)

> - the ability to interactively retrieve and display the Debian changelog
of all available official packages

> - apt-like (i.e. apt-get and apt-cache) command line mode
("aptitude install foo")

> - Score-based dependency resolver which is more suitable
for interactive dependency resolution with additional hints from the user
like "I don't want that part of the solution
but keep that other part of the solution for your next try".
APT's dependency resolver, on the other hand,
is optimized for good "one shot" solutions.
