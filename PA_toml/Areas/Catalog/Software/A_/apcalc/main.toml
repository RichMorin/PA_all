> Calc is an interactive calculator which provides
for easy large numeric calculations,
but which also can be easily programmed for difficult or long calculations.
It can accept a command line argument,
in which case it executes that single command and exits.
Otherwise, it enters interactive mode.
In this mode, it accepts commands one at a time, processes them,
and displays the answers.
In the simplest case, commands are simply expressions which are evaluated.
