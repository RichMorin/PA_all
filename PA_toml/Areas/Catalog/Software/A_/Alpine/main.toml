> Alpine is an upgrade of the well-known PINE email client.  Its name
derives from the use of the Apache License and its ties to PINE.  It
features a full suite of support for mail protocols like IMAP and SMTP
and security protocols like TLS.  It uses curses for its interface.

> The purpose of this page is to offer a collection of patches
for the mail and news program Alpine,
in order to add new or missing features or fix small bugs.
Alpine used to be developed until 2008 by the University of Washington,
but this site provides updates to that software.
The latest update was version 2.21.
Usual disclaimers about suitability for any purpose or any express guarantee
apply. This means that you have to use these patches at your own risk.
Having said that, I use and actively support most of the patches
in this web page.
