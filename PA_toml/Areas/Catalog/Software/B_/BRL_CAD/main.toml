> BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform Open Source combinatorial Constructive
Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling system that includes
interactive 3D solid geometry editing,
high-performance ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis,
network-distributed framebuffer support,
image and signal-processing tools,
path-tracing and photon mapping support for realistic image synthesis,
a system performance analysis benchmark suite,
an embedded scripting interface, and libraries
for robust high-performance geometric representation and analysis.
