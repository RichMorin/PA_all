> BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities
into a single small executable.
It provides minimalist replacements for the most common utilities
you would usually find on your desktop system
(i.e., ls, cp, mv, mount, tar, etc.).
The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options
than their full-featured GNU cousins;
however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality
and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.

> This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install symlinks
for any of the supported utilities.
Some of the utilities can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd, busybox-udhcpc, or busybox-udhcpd packages.
