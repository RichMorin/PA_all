Although BrailleBlaster is an important and valuable offering,
the distribution model is awkward and unduly restrictive.
Specifically, each user is required to provide an email address
before s/he can download and install a binary copy of the utility.

Apparently (I can't find any license documentation),
the software is "free as in beer" (i.e., _gratis_),
but not "free as in speech" (i.e., _libre_).
If so, it cannot be distributed as a turn-key part of a larger system.
This seems quite counter-productive, so I'm hoping for a change
to an open source distribution and licensing model.
