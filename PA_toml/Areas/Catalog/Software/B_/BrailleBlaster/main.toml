> BrailleBlaster is a braille transcription program developed by the
[American Printing House for the Blind]{https://www.aph.org}
to help transcribers provide blind students with braille textbooks
on the first day of class.

> BrailleBlaster takes advantage of the rich markup contained
in NIMAS (National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard) files
to automate basic formatting and gives you tools
to make advanced tasks quicker and easier.
Designed primarily for editing textbooks that meet the specifications published
by the Braille Authority of North America, the purpose of BrailleBlaster
is to help braille producers ensure that every student
has their braille textbooks on the first day of class.

> BrailleBlaster relies on [Liblouis]{http://liblouis.org},
a well-known open-source braille translator,
for translating text and mathematics to braille.
