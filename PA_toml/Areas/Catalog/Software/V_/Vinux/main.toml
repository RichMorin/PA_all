> Vinux is an Ubuntu-derived distribution optimised for the needs of blind
and partially sighted users.  By default, Vinux provides two screen
readers, Braille display support, and an extremely friendly community.

> Vinux is based on Ubuntu and only supports Intel-compatible hardware.
Vinux provides three desktop environments: Unity, GNOME, and MATE.

> We are now offering other speech engines for Vinux as an alternative to
ESpeak, the default synthesizer.  At the moment, you can purchase Voxin,
which is a speech synthesiser that sounds similar to Eloquence as used
with JAWS for Windows.
