> VLC is the VideoLAN project's media player.
It plays MPEG, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, MOV, WMV, QuickTime, WebM, FLAC, MP3,
Ogg/Vorbis files, DVDs, VCDs, podcasts,
and multimedia streams from various network sources.

> VLC can also be used as a streaming server
that duplicates the streams it reads
and multicasts them through the network to other clients,
or serves them through HTTP.
VLC has support for on-the-fly transcoding of audio and video formats,
either for broadcasting purposes or for movie format transformations.
