> PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes,
meaning that it is a proxy for your sound applications.
It allows you to do advanced operations on your sound data
as it passes between your application and your hardware.
Things like transferring the audio to a different machine,
changing the sample format or channel count and mixing several sounds
into one are easily achieved using a sound server.

> PulseAudio is designed for Linux systems.
It has also been ported to and tested
on Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

> PulseAudio is an integral part of all relevant modern Linux distributions
and used in various mobile devices by multiple vendors.
