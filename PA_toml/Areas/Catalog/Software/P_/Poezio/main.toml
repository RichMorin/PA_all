> Poezio is a console Jabber/XMPP client.  Its goal is to use anonymous
connections to simply let the user join MultiUserChats.  This way, the
user doesn't have to create a Jabber account, exactly like people are
using IRC.  Poezio's commands are designed to be (if possible) like
commonly used IRC clients (weechat, irssi, etc).
