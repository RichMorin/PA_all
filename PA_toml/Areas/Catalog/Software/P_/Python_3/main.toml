> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability
with its notable use of significant whitespace.
Its language constructs and object-oriented approach
aim to help programmers write clear, logical code
for small and large-scale projects.
