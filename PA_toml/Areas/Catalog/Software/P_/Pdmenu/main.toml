> Pdmenu is a full screen menuing system for Unix.
It is designed to be easy to use, and is suitable as a login shell
for inexperienced users, or it can just be run at the command line
as a handy menu.

> Pdmenu features color support and GPM mouse support at the Linux console.
It was developed on Linux, and has now been compiled on many other unixes
without problems.

> I was prompted to write Pdmenu when I took a look at a shell script
that used dialog to generate similar menus.
The shell script was huge, complicated, and ugly,
and had to be modified manually to add anything to the menu.
I hope that Pdmenu is better.
