> Pyspread is a non-traditional spreadsheet that is based on
and written in the programming language Python.

> The goal of pyspread is to be the most pythonic spreadsheet.

> Pyspread expects Python expressions in its grid cells,
which makes a spreadsheet-specific language obsolete.
Each cell returns a Python object that can be accessed from other cells.
These objects can represent anything including lists or matrices.
