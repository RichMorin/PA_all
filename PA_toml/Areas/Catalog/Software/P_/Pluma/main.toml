> Pluma is a text editor which supports most standard editor features.
It also extends this basic functionality with other features
not usually found in simple text editors.
Pluma is a graphical application which supports editing multiple text files
in one window (known sometimes as tabs or MDI).
Pluma fully supports international text through its use
of the Unicode UTF-8 encoding in edited files.
Its core feature set includes syntax highlighting of source code,
auto indentation, and printing support (with print preview).
Pluma is a fork of Gedit.
