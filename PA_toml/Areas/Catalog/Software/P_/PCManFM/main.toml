> PCMan File Manager (PCManFM) is a file manager application,
developed by Hong Jen Yee from Taiwan.
It is meant to be a replacement for Nautilus, Konqueror, and Thunar.
Released under the GNU General Public License, PCManFM is free software.
PCManFM is the standard file manager in LXDE,
which is also developed by the same author in conjunction with other developers. Since 2010, PCManFM has undergone a complete rewrite from scratch. So the new PCManFM is totally different from the old 0.5.x series. Build instructions, the ways to setup, and configuration files are different, too.

PCManFM is intended to follow the specifications given by Freedesktop.org
for interoperability in free software.
