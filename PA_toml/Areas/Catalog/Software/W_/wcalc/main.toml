> Wcalc is a very capable calculator.  It has standard functions (sin, asin,
and sinh for example, in either radians or degrees), many pre-defined
constants (pi, e, c, etc.), support for using variables, "active"
variables, a command history, hex/octal/binary input and output, unit
conversions, embedded comments, and an expandable expression entry field.
It evaluates expressions using the standard order of operations.
