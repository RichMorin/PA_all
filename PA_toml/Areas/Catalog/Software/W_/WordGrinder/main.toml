> WordGrinder is a word processor for processing words.
It is not WYSIWYG.
It is not point and click.
It is not a desktop publisher.
It is not a text editor.
It does not do fonts and it barely does styles.
What it does do is words.
It's designed for writing text.
It gets out of your way and lets you type.
