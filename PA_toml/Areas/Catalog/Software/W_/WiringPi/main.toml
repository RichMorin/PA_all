> WiringPi is a PIN based GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835
used in the Raspberry Pi.  It's released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and
is usable from C, C++, and RTB (BASIC) as well as many other languages
with suitable wrappers.  It's designed to be familiar to people who have
used the Arduino "wiring" system.
