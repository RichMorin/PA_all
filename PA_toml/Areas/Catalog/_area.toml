This area is a crowd-sourced, curated [web portal]{ext_wp|Web_portal},
covering accessible and assistive technologies, related organizations, etc.
It includes both items of specific and incidental interest to the disabled.
For example, although the [Anova Precision Cooker]{cat_har|Anova_PC}
isn't marketed as assistive technology,
its [Bluetooth]{ext_wp|Bluetooth} and [Wi-Fi]{ext_wp|Wi-Fi} connectivity
make it accessible to the blind.
