> Roughly 30.6 million individuals in the US have physical disabilities
that affect their ambulatory activities; nearly half of those individuals
report using an assistive aid such as a wheelchair, cane, crutches, or walker.
Despite comprehensive civil rights legislation for Americans with disabilities,
many city streets, sidewalks, and businesses remain inaccessible.
The problem is not just that street-level accessibility affects where and how
people travel in cities but also that there are few, if any, mechanisms
to determine accessible areas of a city a priori.

> This project describes a two-pronged vision:
first, to develop scalable data collection methods
for acquiring sidewalk accessibility information
using a combination of crowdsourcing, computer vision, and online map imagery,
and second, to use this new data to design, develop, and evaluate
a novel set of navigation and map tools for accessibility.
Our overarching goal is to transform the ways in which
accessibility information is collected and visualized
for every sidewalk, street, and building facade in America.
