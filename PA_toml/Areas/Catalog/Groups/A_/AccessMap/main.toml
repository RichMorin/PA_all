  verbose     = '''
The AccessMap team is building a mapping application
that creates interactive map displays of the physical environment
in and around pedestrian ways.
Our aim is to enhance representations to assist people with disabilities
in planning their routes.
The application incorporates mapping, GIS data, municipality-specific data,
transportation information, and eventually weather and other state-specific
information like construction.
