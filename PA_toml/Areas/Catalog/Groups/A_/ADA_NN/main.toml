on how to implement the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in order
to support the mission of the ADA to "assure equality of opportunity,
full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency
for individuals with disabilities."

> Funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living,
and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR), the network consists of 10
Regional ADA Centers located throughout the United States and an ADA
Knowledge Translation Center (ADAKTC). 

> Each Regional ADA Center focuses on its region's unique needs. This
regional focus is critical to ensuring that ADA National Network
services meet the needs of a diversity of populations and stakeholders
throughout the country.
