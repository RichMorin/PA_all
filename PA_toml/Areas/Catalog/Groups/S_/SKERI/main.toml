> Our mission is to create a unique environment for research on human
vision -- basic scientific research to increase the understanding of
normal vision in support of vision disorders, clinical research to
develop new diagnostic procedures and treatments for visual and other
sensory disorders, and engineering research to produce better techniques
for aid and rehabilitation of the blind and partially sighted.

> To this end, we will maintain an independent research institute which
maximizes individual responsibility and innovation, which promotes a
balance of laboratory, clinical and rehabilitation scientists, and
which limits size in order to foster mutually supportive research
collaborations.
