> Visioneers (World Access for the Blind) is a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit
organization that facilitates the self-directed achievement of people
with all forms of blindness, and increases public awareness about the
strengths and capabilities of blind people.

> World Access for the Blind strives to improve the quality of interaction
between blind and sighted people by facilitating equal access to the
world's resources and opportunities.  We are interested in more than
meeting the minimum requirements for functioning and life satisfaction.
We believe in mutual respect, consideration, and accommodation of blind
and sighted people by society. We expect to see the blind population on
mass rise to levels of productive participation and achievement to compare
with those of sighted people.
