> Any person has the right to use Mapillary images
for editing and deriving metadata for contributing content to OpenStreetMap.
We’re making Mapillary images and the data extracted from them
available for OpenStreetMap for free, always.
We’re working closely with people and organizations in the OpenStreetMap network
around building better tools for using Mapillary images and data,
and anyone can contribute to this process.
We’re committed to supporting OpenStreetMap now and always.
