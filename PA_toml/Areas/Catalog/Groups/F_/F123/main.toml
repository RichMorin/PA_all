> F123, a Brazilian social enterprise devoted to improving opportunities
for education and employment for the blind and visually impaired, has
developed a portable, affordable talking computer to help visually
impaired people.  The idea is to help those suffering from blindness or
partial vision by providing them with high-quality, low-cost, multi-lingual
software that allows them to live with a degree of personal independence
that they could not have otherwise.

> F123 has produced F123 Access, a web browser extension that makes web sites
more accessible to the blind.  They are working on a blind-accessible version
of GNU/Linux, to be run on the Raspberry Pi and similar computers.

*Note:*
As of September 2019, the F123 folks are in the early stages
of rebranding themselves as [VOISS]{https://www.voiss.tech/en}.
Although this may cause some confusion, stay calm:
their basic mission is unchanged.
When the dust settles a little, I'll come back and edit the nomenclature.
