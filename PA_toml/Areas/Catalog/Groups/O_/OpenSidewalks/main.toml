> Sidewalks provide a primary mode of travel that supports nearly all other
travel options, leisure, recreation and community activities.
This project seeks to make pedestrian ways, particularly sidewalks,
first class members of an open data transportation network.
The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project has made available extensive,
user-contributed open data on transportation networks,
providing the basis for many use cases and downstream activities,
including rich analytics, travel route optimization, city planning,
and disaster relief.
Some footways have been annotated in OSM as independent routes.
However, sidewalks in the built environment have generally been treated
an addendum to streets.

> As a result,
sidewalks in OSM have spotty coverage and an unintuitive implementation.
The current standard makes user contribution difficult and fails to serve
many use cases, including the needs of people with limited mobility.
This project proposes to jumpstart an effort to generate an OSM-based
pedestrian network with global coverage.
