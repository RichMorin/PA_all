> The BuzzClip is a small and discreet wearable for people living with
blindness or partial sight.  The device uses ultrasound to detect obstacles
that may lie directly in one's path.  It then notifies the user of these
obstacles through intuitive vibrations, allowing the user to safely
navigate around any objects that they may encounter.  The BuzzClip offers
essential head level obstacle detection and can be easily held or attached
to many forms of clothing, making it a highly versatile and useful device.
