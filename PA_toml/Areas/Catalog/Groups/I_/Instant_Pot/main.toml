> Instant Brands Inc. was founded in 2009 by a team of Canadian technology
veterans who set out to explore the food preparation category based on
their own personal life experiences.  Their objective was to find solutions
that would enable busy families and professionals to prepare quality food
in less time, promoting better eating and reducing the consumption of fast
food.

> In late 2010, after eighteen grueling months of research, design, and
development, they introduced the Instant Pot CSG Multi-Use Programmable
Pressure Cooker.  The product was developed with an advanced microprocessor
and incorporated the functions of five cooking appliances into one:
pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, and warmer.
