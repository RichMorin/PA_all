> The purpose of the Accessible Course Materials Initiative is to provide
help and guidance to the campus community in ensuring that course
materials delivered in digital form are accessible to all students.  In
digital documents, the absence of document structure, image descriptions,
color contrast, table navigation, etc. can pose major barriers to
students, such as those who rely on screen readers or screen magnification.

> Remediation and conversion of existing inaccessible course material is one
approach to the problem.  A better approach is to design accessible content
from the start.  This website provides help for both approaches.  Where
possible, the guidance we offer on this website is in the spirit of
Universal Design for Learning (UDL), a pedagogical framework that promotes
flexibility in accommodating learners' individual needs and differences.
