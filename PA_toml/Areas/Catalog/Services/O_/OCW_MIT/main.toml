Q: Is the MIT OpenCourseWare site compliant with W3C standards and
accessibility requirements?

Our webpage templates are both valid HTML 4.01 and meet Sec. 508 &
WCAG AA Web Accessibility recommendations.  Our style guide includes
validating and checking the accessibility of HTML as part of the
authoring process.  Our standards require all images on our web pages
to contain ALT attributes.  Our data tables contain heavy use of the
scope and headers attributes that make it easier to navigate using
screenreaders such as JAWS.

To make our PDFs accessible, we replace any Type 3 or bitmapped fonts
within the file, and use Adobe's "Make Accessible" plugin before
finalizing the document.

Videos with subtitles can be accessed directly through our Courses with
Subtitled Audio/Video list.

> OCW is a free and open publication of material from thousands of MIT
courses, covering the entire MIT curriculum.  That's every MIT
department and degree program, and ranging from the introductory to
the most advanced graduate level.  Each OCW course includes a syllabus,
some instructional material (such as lecture notes or a reading list),
and some learning activities (such as assignments or exams).  Many
courses also have complete video lectures, free online textbooks, and
faculty teaching insights.  While some OCW content is custom-created
for online use, most of it comes straight from the MIT classroom.
