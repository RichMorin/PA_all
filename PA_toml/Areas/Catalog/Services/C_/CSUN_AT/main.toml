> For over 30 years, the Center on Disabilities, through the CSUN Assistive
Technology Conference, has provided an inclusive setting for researchers,
practitioners, exhibitors, end users, speakers and other participants to
share knowledge and best practices in the field of assistive technology.
In 2016, the conference drew more than 4,800 people to San Diego.  Known
as a forum that showcases cutting edge technology and practical solutions
that can be utilized to remove the barriers that prevent the full
participation of persons with disabilities in educational, workplace and
social settings, the conference is the largest of its kind in the world.
