The Anova Precision Cooker is an immersion sous-vide cooker
with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi access.
It can be used to cook vegetables, meat, etc.

I use mine primarily to cook fish, which I then saute in a skillet.
For example, two hours of immersion will thaw and then cook a slab
of hard-frozen salmon or tuna from Trader Joes.
The fish could then sit safely in the water bath for another hour or so,
but it never does in my house!
