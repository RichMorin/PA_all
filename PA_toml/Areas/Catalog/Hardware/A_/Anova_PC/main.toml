> _Sous vide_ (pronounced "sue-veed") is a cooking technique that makes it
super simple to achieve professional-quality results at home.  The
technique utilizes precise temperature control to deliver super-juicy,
flavor-packed results from edge to edge, every time.  To cook _sous vide_,
food is placed in a sealable bag and cooked in a water bath.

> The Anova Precision Cooker circulates water around the pot.  The circulation
prevents hot and cool spots from forming in the water to ensure an even
temperature throughout your food.  Food never overcooks.  It's just how you
like it, every time.
