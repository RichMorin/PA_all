> [VOISS]{https://www.voiss.tech/en} team has developed the VOISS Classic,
the world’s most affordable fully functional talking computer for the blind.
The project’s objective is to enhance access to education and employment
for the blind through the use of low-cost competitive technologies, training,
and technical support.
The strategy is to scale-up through the use of mass-produced and easily
assembled hardware kits, as well as freely distributed and cooperatively
developed open source software.
