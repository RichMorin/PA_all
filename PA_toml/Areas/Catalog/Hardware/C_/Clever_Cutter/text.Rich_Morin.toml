The Clever Cutter is a safe, convenient tool
for chopping up small, crunchy pieces of vegetables.
It's kind of an oversized "anvil pruner", adapted for use in the kitchen.
Squeezing the handles forces a 4" long blade against a plastic "anvil".

It works well for crunchy vegetables such as carrots, celery, and potatoes.
And, because the blade is quite dull, stray fingers are unlikely to be harmed.
However, this also means that the Clever Cutter isn't a great tool
for cutting up meat, slicing tomatoes, etc.
