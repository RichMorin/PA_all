The server code for Pete's Alley is written primarily in the
[Elixir]{ext_wp|Elixir_(programming_language)} programming language,
using the [Phoenix]{ext_wp|Phoenix_(web_framework)} web framework,
the [Mix]{ext_wp|Mix_(build_tool)} build tool, etc.
This combination, along with the fact that the server is structured
as an "umbrella" application with several application sub-trees,
determines the shape of the file tree.

### File Tree

Here is a rough summary of the file tree.

    PA_elixir/                the code file tree
    | server/                 server code for Pete's Alley
    | | _build/...            compiled binary files, etc.
    | | apps/                 applications and libraries
    | | | common/             commonly-used functions
    | | | info_files/...      provides info on file trees
    | | | info_toml/...       provides info on TOML files
    | | | info_web/...        provides info on web servers
    | | | phx_http/...        Phoenix server code
    | | | sample/...          sample generated application
    | | config/...            configuration files
    | | deps/...              top-level dependencies

The `common` and `info_*` sub-trees have the following structure:

    common/                   commonly-used functions
    | _build/...              compiled binary files, etc.
    | deps/...                top-level dependencies
    | doc/...                 generated documentation files
    | lib/...                 application library files
    | | common/*.ex           implementation files
    | | common.ex             interface file
    | test/...                application test files

The `phx_http` sub-tree is a bit more complicated:

    phx_http/                 Phoenix (HTTP server) code
    | _build/...              compiled binary files, etc.
    | assets/...              CSS, JavaScript, etc.
    | config/...              configuration files
    | deps/...                top-level dependencies
    | doc/...                 generated documentation files
    | lib/...                 application library files
    | | phx_http/*.ex         application.ex file, etc.
    | | phx_http_web/         web-related files
    | | | channels/...        support for web sockets, etc.
    | | | controllers/...     request-handling code
    | | | templates/...       embedded Elixir files
    | | | views/...           template support functions
    | priv/...                private (generated) files
    | test/...                application test files
