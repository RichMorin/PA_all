The goals of Pete's Alley do not require fancy layouts
or much in the way of interactive widgets.
All we really need is clean and predictable organization,
supported by appropriate [HTML]{ext_wp|HTML} tags
and a small amount of [CSS]{ext_wp|Cascading_Style_Sheets}
and [JavaScript]{ext_wp|JavaScript}.
This means that we can use a simple (some might say boring) approach
to web design.

Although I'm neither an expert on accessibility nor an expert web designer,
I've been creating web pages and using markup languages for decades.
Based on this experience,
I'm attempting to follow [best practices]{ext_wp|Best_practice}
in accessible and inclusive web design.
[Accessible Technology at the UW]{http://www.washington.edu/accessibility}
does a nice job of laying out the major objectives;
please let me know of any ways in which the site falls short.

### Page Generation

Most of the pages in Pete's Alley, like this one,
are generated from [TOML]{ext_wp|TOML} files
with [Markdown]{ext_wp|Markdown} inclusions.
The actual page rendering is performed
by [Elixir]{ext_wp|Elixir_(programming_language)} code
(e.g., [Earmark]{ext_gh|pragdave/earmark}
and the [Phoenix Framework]{ext_wp|Phoenix_(web_framework)}.
This approach allows global changes to be made quickly and easily,
while still keeping the rendering latency under control.

#### Sanity Checks

As each page is loaded, assorted sanity checks are performed.
Failure of any of these checks causes the page to be ignored.
For example:

- Are all of the map keys present in the schema?
- Are all of the required map keys present?
- Do any values contain <code>??</code> or only white space?
- Is any `meta.ref` value missing a prefix string?
- Is the `publish` value present in `meta.actions`?

After all of the pages have been loaded,
more checks are performed to ensure inter-page consistency.
Failure of any of these checks cancels the load.
For example:

- Check for duplicate `id_str` values.
- Check for missing reference items.

Finally, a special-purpose web crawler is used on occasion
to ensure that both internal and external links resolve,
headings don't skip over levels, etc.

### Page Structure

All of the pages use the same basic layout:

- `header`  - initial banner, primary navigation links
- `main`    - main content of the page
- `footer`  - secondary navigation links

The `main` section uses headings, lists, and tables extensively.

### Markdown Links

Many of the links in Pete's Alley are expanded from our flavor
of Markdown syntax into vanilla Markdown and then into HTML.
In the process, we generate and add `title` attributes.
For example, `[TOML]!{ext_wp|TOML}` turns into:

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML"
       title="Go to: TOML [WP]">TOML</a>
