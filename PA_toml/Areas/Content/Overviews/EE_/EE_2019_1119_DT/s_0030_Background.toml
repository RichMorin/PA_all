Dialyzer is a workaround, motivated by a conundrum:

- Erlang, like Prolog, is dynamically typed.
- Static type checking might reveal coding errors.
- Adding static typing could break existing code.

Changing the language definition was not an option:

- Many lines of Erlang code were in production.
- An optional, unintrusive approach was needed.
- Success typing was the "least worst option".
