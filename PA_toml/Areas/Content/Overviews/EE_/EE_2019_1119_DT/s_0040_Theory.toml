All BEAM-based languages are strongly typed:

- Type errors can be detected in various ways.
- Some type errors can be detected statically.
- Others can slip through into running code.

Dialyzer compares function calls to definitions:

- Determine the union of its type signatures.
- Calls which conform to a signature "succeed".
- The remainder are reported as possible errors.
