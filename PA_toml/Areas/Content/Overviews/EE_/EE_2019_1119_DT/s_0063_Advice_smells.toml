  verbose     = '''
Stay alert for assorted code smells.  For example:

- `any` may indicate a sub-optimal interface design
- `list`, `map`, and `tuple` can hide a lot of complexity
- `number` should be promoted to `float`, `integer`, etc.

Keep your code tidy and DRY:

- Aliases and guards can make specs easier to read.
- Complex literals may warrant definition as types.
