Per Dave Thomas, I separate interfaces and implementations:

    .../apps/foo/lib/
    | foo/
    | | _foo_t.ex   # Foo.Types (@type, @typedoc, typep, ...)
    | | bar.ex      # Foo.Bar   (@doc, @spec, def, defp, ...)
    | | ...
    | foo.ex        # Foo       (@doc, defdelegate, ...)

This makes the code much easier to read and maintain:

- Files are smaller, so they are easier to read and safer to edit. 
- Modules are also smaller, less coupled, and more cohesive. 
- Implementation functions and modules can be documented.
