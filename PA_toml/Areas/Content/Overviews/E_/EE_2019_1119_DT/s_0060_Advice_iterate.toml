  verbose     = '''
I recommend using a cautious, iterative approach:

- Before writing *any* specs, run Dialyzer.
- Clean up problems until it goes quiet.
- Add (or tighten) a few specs at a time.<br><br>
- Fix (or work around) reported problems.
- If need be, loosen or even disable specs.
- Rinse, repeat...
