In summary, Dialyzer:

- performs program-wide detection of type conflicts
- uses both type inference and explicit specifications

The diagnostics are generally reliable, but imperfect:

- Dialyzer very seldom produces false positives.
- Reports can be incomplete, opaque, and voluminous.
- Interpreting the results can take a bit of practice.
- Loose or missing specs may prevent error detection.
