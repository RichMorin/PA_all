  verbose     = '''
Why I don't use Ecto:

- This is a read-mostly application.
- The amount of data is pretty small.
- Ecto brings in a lot of complexity.
- The relational model isn't a good fit.

What I do, instead:

- Load input files into a tree of maps.
- Build some index data structures.
- Store and access all this via actors.
- Code up search logic (etc), as needed.
