  verbose     = '''
Because Perkify runs as a [virtual machine]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine},
adding audio (e.g., speech) support is different than it might be
on a native [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux} installation.
This page is an early attempt at gathering information on the differences
and underlying issues.

### Packages

#### BRLTTY

There are two Debian packages for BRLTTY:

- brltty-espeak  - uses espeak directly
- brltty-speechd - uses speech-dispatcher

#### Emacspeak

Emacspeak supports several hardware and software speech synthesizers,
but ViaVoice TTS appears to be the golden path, in terms of software.

#### Orca


#### Speakup

- speakup - uses espeak
