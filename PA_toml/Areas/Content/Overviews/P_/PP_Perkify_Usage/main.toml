The [Perkify - Install]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Install} page
contains installation instructions and a few example commands,
but it doesn't really concentrate on how to use Perkify.
So, let's dig into that topic a little...

### Background

Perkify is, at heart, a [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux} distribution.
Specifically, it is based on [Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu},
a "batteries included" distribution intended for end users.
Because Ubuntu is based on [Debian]{ext_wp|Debian},
it has access to an immense suite of installable packages
via Debian's Advanced Package Tool ([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(Package_Manager)}).
Using APT and other [package managers]{ext_wp|Package_manager},
we fold in a variety of commands, libraries, etc. 
If there is something you'd like us to add, please let us know!
(Be sure to include relevant links and your reasons for its inclusion.)

Perkify is distributed as a [Vagrant]{ext_wp|Vagrant_(software)} "box",
containing a [VirtualBox]{ext_wp|Virtual_Box}
virtual machine ([VM]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine}) image.
Although this description hides a great deal of complexity,
you don't need to know the details in order to manage the VM.
And, because everything can be done from the command line,
you won't have to deal with the vagaries of
Graphical User Interfaces ([GUIs]{ext_wp|Graphical_user_interface}).

### The `vagrant` command

Most of Vagrant's operation and administration is performed
using variations on the `vagrant` command.
There are dozens of sub-commands,
so this section is just a brief introduction for Perkify users.
For more detailed information, check out this
[Cheat Sheet]{https://gist.github.com/wpscholar/a49594e2e2b918f4d0c4}
or the Vagrant
[Command-Line Interface]{https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli} page.

#### `vagrant -h`

This displays help text for the `vagrant` command.
Mostly, it summarizes the available sub-commands:

    $ vagrant -h
    Usage: vagrant [options] <command> [<args>]

      -v, --version   Print the version and exit.
      -h, --help      Print this help.

    Common commands:
      box             manages boxes: installation, removal, etc.
      cloud           manages everything related to Vagrant Cloud
      ...
    ...

#### `vagrant destroy`

This halts (shuts down) the Vagrant VM and destroys any saved machine state.
Use this if you've mangled the VM and want to start over from a fresh image.

#### `vagrant halt`

This halts (shuts down) the Vagrant VM, saving any persistent machine state.

#### `vagrant init`

This initializes a new Vagrant environment by creating a `Vagrantfile`
and a `.vagrant` directory.
Once Vagrant has been set up, you can generally forget about this sub-command.

#### `vagrant ssh`

This sets up a Secure Shell ([SSH]{ext_wp|Secure_Shell}) connection
to the Vagrant VM.
It can be run multiple times, producing multiple shell sessions.

#### `vagrant status`

This displays the status of the Vagrant machine(s) on the host system.

#### `vagrant suspend` / `vagrant resume`

This pair of commands is useful if you want to temporarily suspend the VM
and resume its operation later.
This approach retains both persistent and transient state
and avoids doing a full boot of the guest OS.

#### `vagrant up`

This starts up a Vagrant VM, possibly downloading the needed image files.
In general, this sub-command should be run in the `~/perkify` directory.

### Access

Once the Perkify VM has been started (via `vagrant up`),
it acts very much like an Ubuntu-based system on your
local area network ([LAN]{ext_wp|Local_area_network}).
So, it can provide Secure Shell ([SSH]{ext_wp|Secure_Shell}) access,
[web servers]{ext_wp|Web_server}, and other networked services.
It can also access both its own file system and that of the host machine.

#### File Access

Although a running Linux system has a number of mounted file systems
(run `df -k` for an overview), most Perkify users will only be concerned
with a few directories:

- `/home/vagrant` - the home directory for the `vagrant` user
- `/vagrant`      - a synchronized copy of `~/perkify` on the host OS

In order to access host files from within the VM,
you may want to add more synchronized directories.
See [Perkify - Configuration]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Config} for details.

#### Shell Access

Getting access to a Perkify shell session from the host OS is simple:
just run the `vagrant ssh` command.
Getting access from another machine takes only a little more work:

    user@foo $ ssh user@bar   # SSH to machine `bar`

    user@bar $ cd perkify     # go to `~/perkify`
    user@bar $ vagrant ssh    # SSH to the Perkify VM

    vagrant@perkify:~$        # and here you are...

Once you have shell access, the next thing you might want to do
is search for interesting and/or useful packages.
Because Perkify is so large, this can be a challenge,
but see the [Perkify - Search]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Search} page for ideas.

#### Web Access

It's quite possible to run a web server within the Perkify VM.
In fact, a copy of [Apache]{ext_wp|Apache_HTTP_Server} is enabled by default.
However, in order to access web servers from outside the VM,
their ports must be "forwarded" to the host machine.
For details, read the [Forwarded Ports
]{https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/forwarded_ports.html} page.

The Apache server normally communicates via port 80.
By convention, Vagrant forwards this port on the VM to port 8080 on the host.
So, you can access this web server as 
[$url]{http://localhost:8080}.
All you'll get if you access this URL is a placeholder `index.html` file,
located in the `~/_base/html` directory.
Feel free to season to taste...

#### Weird Access

Although the Vagrant documentation strongly suggests the use of port forwarding,
the Vagrant software is quite willing to let you set up
private and public networks, etc.
Just understand that any confusion (or security holes) you create
are your own problem.
For details, read Vagrant's
[Networking]{https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking} page.

### Resources

At this point, you should have enough knowledge to go off on your own.
Check out the [Packages]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Packages} page for ideas.
Also, you'll certainly have questions about Linux, Ubuntu, and Vagrant.
See the [Perkify - Resources]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Resources} page
for some pointers.
