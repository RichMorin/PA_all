Perkify provides a convenient way to add accessibility-focused software
to personal computers running [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux},
[macOS]{ext_wp|MacOS}, or [Windows]{ext_wp|Microsoft_Windows}.
This includes a large (and growing!) suite of commands,
the prospect of personal web servers, etc.

### Motivation

The [open source]{ext_wp|Open_source} community has produced a wealth
of software which could be of use to the disabled.
For example, there are text-based applications
for processing audio, documents, images, and more.
Unfortunately, installing and configuring this software can be difficult
and time consuming.
There are also issues of library and operating system incompatibility.
So, most of these offerings are effectively unavailable
to typical computer users.

The [Perkian Project]{con_ove|PP_Perkian_Intro} has been
cataloging and evaluating accessibility-focused software,
in the hope of making it more widely available.
Eventually, Perkian may be released as a Linux distribution
for [mobile phones]{ext_wp|Mobile_phone},
[subnotebook computers]{ext_wp|Subnotebook}, etc.
In the meanwhile, Perkify provides a way to add this software
to personal computers.

### Virtual Machines

Because Perkify's approach is based on
[virtual machine]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine} technology,
a short primer may be in order.
Feel free to skip this section;
you can always come back to it if you get confused later on...

Virtual machines (VMs) have been around since the 1960s.
In general, they allow software to pretend that it is running
in a different environment than the host computer provides.
This enables software developers to sidestep various kinds
of incompatibilities:

- [computer architecture]{ext_wp|Computer_architecture}
- [file system]{ext_wp|File_system} layout
- [operating system]{ext_wp|Operating_system}
- [software libraries]{ext_wp|Library_(computing)}
- [utility software]{ext_wp|Utility_software}

In general, emulating more fundamental aspects of the environment
requires more processing time and so, is less performant.
In order to achieve reasonable performance,
Perkify uses only two, relatively lightweight forms of VM technology:

The [hypervisor]{ext_wp|Hypervisor} approach,
as used by [Virtual Box]{ext_wp|Virtual_Box}, can emulate
an entirely different OS [kernel]{ext_wp|Kernel_(operating_system)}.
For example, it can let [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux}-based software run
on a [macOS]{ext_wp|MacOS} or [Windows]{ext_wp|Microsoft_Windows} system.
This is the current thrust of our development efforts.
For implementation details,
see [Perkify - Making Vagrant Boxes]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Make_VB}.

[OS-level virtualisation]{ext_wp|OS-level_virtualisation}
assumes that the guest and host system
have the same OS [kernel]{ext_wp|Kernel_(operating_system)}
and computer architecture.
So, for example, a [Docker]{ext_wp|Docker_(software)} container
might allow an [Arch Linux]{ext_wp|Arch_Linux} system to host
an [Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu} Linux environment.
On a resource-limited system, this might be a worthwhile approach.
For details, see [Perkify - Docker]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Docker}.

### Usage Overview

Once the Perkify VM is installed and running,
it can be accessed in various ways.
However, the most common ones will be command line and web access.
In either case, the VM will act a lot like a Linux box located somwhere
on the user's local area network ([LAN]{ext_wp|Local_area_network}).

Command line access allows the user to obtain an interactive
[shell]{ext_wp|Unix_shell} session on the VM.
Because the Perkify VM is emulating a Ubuntu Linux environment,
the default shell would be [Bash]{ext_wp|Bash_(Unix_shell)}.
All of the normal commands (e.g., `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`)
would be available, along with zillions of commands added by Perkify.

Web access allows the user to obtain an interactive
[browser]{ext_wp|Web_browser} session,
supported by a [personal web server]{ext_wp|Personal_web_server}
running in the VM.
We have various ideas for this sort of thing; details at 11.

### Getting Started

The [Perkify - Setup]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Setup} page
describes the steps needed to install Perkify and its prerequisites.
Once things are working, you can move on the
[Perkify - Usage]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Usage} page.
