Perkify provides a convenient and unintrusive way
to add [open source]{ext_wp|Open_source} software
to personal computers running [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux},
[macOS]{ext_wp|MacOS}, or [Windows]{ext_wp|Microsoft_Windows}.
The Perkify distribution provides thousands
of command-line tools and support libraries,
offers the prospect of personal web servers, and more.

### Motivation

The open source community has produced a wealth of software,
much of which could be of use to the visually disabled.
For example, there are text-based applications
for processing audio, documents, images, and more.
There are also a number of specialized programs
that are intended to assist blind and/or visually-impaired users.

Unfortunately, installing and configuring this software
presents a largely impassable barrier to entry for many users.
Issues of library and operating system incompatibility
can make it difficult or even impossible to install packages.
Worse, the attempt to install software can destabilize the operating system,
causing existing software to malfunction.
Even when everything goes "as designed",
the process tends to be confusing, tedious, and time consuming.

The [Perkian Project]{con_ove|PP_Perkian_Intro} has been
cataloging and evaluating accessibility-focused software,
in the hope of making it more widely available.
Eventually, Perkian may be released as a Linux distribution
for [mobile phones]{ext_wp|Mobile_phone},
[subnotebook computers]{ext_wp|Subnotebook}, etc.
In the meanwhile, Perkify provides a way to add this software
to personal computers.

### Project Approach

We start with a copy of [Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu},
a "batteries included" version of [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux}.
Then, using [Debian]{ext_wp|Debian}'s Advanced Package Toolkit
([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(Package_Manager)}), we add a "wish list"
of packages, plus their dependencies and recommendations.
All told, the release includes about 2500 packages.

Although none of APT's installations "failed", it's very unlikely
that every package is properly configured.
In particular, packages which require access to I/O hardware
are unikely to work at the moment.
(See [Perkify - Issues]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Issues} for details.)
However, we do have a release that folks can download and try out.
So, come on in; the water's (erm) wet...

#### Virtual Machines

Because Perkify's approach is based on
[virtual machine]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine} (VM) technology,
a short primer may be in order.
VMs allow software to pretend that it is running
in a different environment than the host computer provides.
This lets it sidestep various kinds
of [operating system]{ext_wp|Operating_system} incompatibilities,
including different [kernels]{ext_wp|Kernel_(operating_system)},
[file system]{ext_wp|File_system} layouts,
[libraries]{ext_wp|Library_(computing)}, and
[utilities]{ext_wp|Utility_software}.

Specifically, we use [Virtual Box]{ext_wp|Virtual_Box},
a [hypervisor]{ext_wp|Hypervisor}-based approach to virtualization.
This lets our Ubuntu-based VM run as an isolated "guest OS",
avoiding unintended interactions with the "host OS".
[Vagrant]{ext_wp|Vagrant_(software)}, an advanced tool for VM management,
allows all interaction to be performed via the command line.

### Usage Overview

Once the Perkify VM is installed and running,
it can be accessed in various ways.
However, the most common modes are command line and web access.
In either case, the VM acts like a mostly-independent Linux box
(with customizable amounts of file sharing).

Command line access lets the user obtain an interactive
[shell]{ext_wp|Unix_shell} session on the VM.
All of the normal Linux commands (e.g., `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`)
are available, along with thousands of added commands.
Web access can support [browser]{ext_wp|Web_browser} sessions
on [personal web servers]{ext_wp|Personal_web_server} running in the VM.

### Getting Started

The [Perkify - Install]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Install} page
describes the steps needed to install Perkify and its prerequisites.
Once things are working, you can move on the
[Perkify - Usage]{con_ove|PP_Perkify_Usage} page.
