### Motivation

Our motivation for using [GitHub]{ext_wp|GitHub} is a bit unusual,
so a bit of explanation may be in order.
Most GitHub projects contain code that is intended for distribution and reuse.
Although anyone is welcome to copy and use our code, our expectation
is that there will only be one "official" server for Pete's Alley;
in any case, we don't expect others to start up competing servers.

However, we'd like folks to be able to play with our code, improve it,
and submit changes.
In particular, having a published copy makes it far easier for folks
to respond to our requests for assistance
(e.g., on [Elixir Forum]{https://elixirforum.com}).
We also expect that some folks will find GitHub useful
as a way to inspect our Elixir and TOML files,
submit additions and proposed changes, etc.

### Git and Mix

Although [Elixir]{ext_wp|Elixir_(programming_language)}'s
[Mix]{ext_wp|Mix_(build_tool)} tooling
does not _require_ the use of [Git]{ext_wp|Git},
that certainly seems to be the expectation.
For example, it automagically creates a `.gitignore` file
in each new project and relies on this to prevent archiving
of (possibly enormous) directory sub-trees such as
`assets/node_modules`, `_build`, and `deps`.

Our code is divided into a number of project directories,
contained within a Mix [umbrella project]{
https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/
dependencies-and-umbrella-projects.html}

A single Git repo resides in the top-level (`PA_all`) directory,
along with a tiny `.gitignore` file.
Each project directory has its own `.gitignore` file (supplied by Mix).
 
#### File Tree

The file tree for Pete's Alley contains
code (e.g., Elixir), data (e.g., [TOML]{ext_wp|TOML}),
and documentation (e.g., [Markdown]{ext_wp|Markdown}).
For details, see the [Code Tree]{con_ove|PA_Code_Tree} and
[Data Tree]{con_ove|PA_Data_Tree} pages.
