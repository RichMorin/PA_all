Perkify is based on a huge amount of existing work,
so you could easily spend years reading up on its underpinnings.
Fortunately, a few selected resources should be enough to get you started.

### Linux

There are hundreds of Linux distributions, each with its own "secret sauce".
There are also hundreds of books and web sites on Linux.
Here are a few pointers to information for "newbies".

- [Linux Beginner Tutorials
  ]{https://www.linux.org/forums/linux-beginner-tutorials.123}

- [The Linux command line for beginners
  ]{https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners}

- [UNIX / LINUX Tutorial
  ]{https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/index.htm}

### Vagrant

Although [Vagrant: Up and Running]{ext_am|B00D3VH4IO}
is a bit dated, it's still a very useful reference.
I also recommend skimming some of the online documentation, including:

- [Command-Line Interface
  ]{https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli}

- [Forwarded Ports
  ]{https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/forwarded_ports.html}

- [Networking
  ]{https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking}

- [Synced Folders
  ]{https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders}

- [Vagrant Documentation
  ]{https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/index.html}

- [Vagrantfile
  ]{https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile}
