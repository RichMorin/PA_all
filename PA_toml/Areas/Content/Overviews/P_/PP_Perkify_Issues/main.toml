This page summarizes [known known]{ext_wp|There_are_known_knowns} issues
for Perkify (VM-based Perkian).
That is, it does not pretend to be comprehensive,
but it gives us a start on where to look for problems.
Currently, we're concentrating on
[APT]{ext_wp|APT_(Package_Manager)}-related issues,
but other archives (etc) are certainly on the horizon...

### Missing APT archives

If the "APT name" is "?", we found no evidence that there had ever been
an APT archive for the package.
If a name is given, there is no archive for the "buster" release of Debian.

### Other APT issues

- Chef            - wants the URL of the Chef Infra server
- Emacspeak       - wants to know about support SW & HW
- GNU Mailutils   - wants to know the Postfix configuration

### The Open Build Service

At the kind suggestion of Steven Pusser (@stevepusser on the
[Debian User Forums]{http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=143406}),
we're investigating the possibility of using the
[openSUSE Build Service]{https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Build_Service}:

> The Open Build Service (OBS) is a generic system to build and distribute
packages from sources in an automatic, consistent, and reproducible way.
It makes it possible to release software for a wide range of operating systems
and hardware architectures.
The OBS reference server, which we use to build our distribution,
currently (March 2019) hosts 62,954 projects, with 527,451 packages,
in 94,872 repositories for numerous distributions and architectures
and is used by 60,034 confirmed developers.

The OBS appears to be a perfect place for interested parties
to collaborate on porting blind-friendly software packages.
If you are interested in helping in this effort, please get in touch!
