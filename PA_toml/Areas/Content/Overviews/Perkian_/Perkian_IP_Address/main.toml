  verbose     = '''
It should be possible to set up a Perkian image
so that even a newly installed system
will boot with Secure Shell ([SSH]{ext_wp|Secure_Shell}) enabled.
So, in theory, the user can simply log in
from a nearby, [Wi-Fi]{ext_wp|Wi-Fi} enabled system.
However, this ignores the issue of determining what
[IP address]{ext_wp|IP_address} the Perkian system will be using.

In the scenario I have in mind,
someone downloads an ISO image and copies it onto a mass storage device
such as a microSD card or a USB flash drive.
They then plug the device into the RasPi and power up the system.
Assuming that the user's location has an active Wi-Fi router,
I'd expect the RasPi to pick up a Class C IP address
from a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
([DHCP]{ext_wp|Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol}) server
and be ready to respond to requests.
So, the user will still need a way to determine the new system's IP address
out of 200+ possibilities.

CFCL uses a "Cisco RV042 10/100 4-Port VPN Router".
This device lets me log in over either Wi-Fi or the wired LAN,
using the password for its `admin` account.
I can then browse through the router's web interface
to the DHCP Status page and examine the Client Table.
This is a fine solution for me, but not something I can suggest
to random users somewhere across the globe.
I've been looking for more general solutions,
but I'm not finding anything very convenient.
So, in the meanwhile, I decided to hack something up...

### Take a Memo

If the user's Local Area Network ([LAN]{ext_wp|Local_area_network})
is connected to the Internet,
one plausible (albeit rather peculiar) possibility would be
to have the RasPi "call home" at boot time,
accessing a specialized web page.
For example, this URL might say that a Perkian system named `frodo`
booted up and received a (local) IP address of `192.168.1.42`:

    http://pa.cfcl.com/memo?hn=frodo&ip=192.168.1.42&os=perkian

The user could then browse to a personalized report page,
which would display the URLs used by the (most recent) calls
from the user's external IP address.
Something like this:

<blockquote>
  <b>Memos for 127.0.0.1</b>
  <p><b>2020-02-20T07:48:04.852401Z</b></p>
  <pre>
hn:        frodo
ip:        192.168.1.42
os:        perkian</pre>
  ...
</blockquote>

Given the power of [Elixir]{ext_wp|Elixir_(programming_language)}
and the [Phoenix]{ext_wp|Phoenix_(web_framework)} framework,
it only took a few dozen lines of code to add this capability to Pete's Alley.
Feel free to give it a try...
