  verbose     = '''
This page summarizes [known known]{ext_wp|There_are_known_knowns} issues
for Perkify (VM-based Perkian).
That is, it does not pretend to be comprehensive,
but it gives us a start on where to look for problems.

### APT-related Issues

If at all possible, we like to install packages using [Debian]{ext_wp|Debian}'s
Advanced Package Manager ([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(software)}).
So, if no APT archive exists, our preferred solution is to generate one.
See the section below on The Open Build Service for one approach to this goal.

#### Missing Archives

If the "APT name" field is "_",
we found no evidence that there had ever been an APT archive for the package.
Otherwise, we found an archive for some earlier release of Debian,
but nothing for Ubuntu "disco".

#### APT Presets

Some APT archives want to ask questions during the build.
This breaks our automation, so we had to guess at some preset values.
Obviously, some of these may be Science Fiction.

| Pkg. Name  | Database Key                      | Type     | Value            |
| ---------  | ------------                      | ----     | -----            |
| chef       | chef/chef_server_url              | string   | localhost:4000   |
| gdm3       | shared/default-x-display-manager  | select   | nodm             |
| jackd2     | jackd/tweak_rt_limits             | boolean  | false            |
| nodm       | nodm/enabled                      | boolean  | false            |
| nodm       | shared/default-x-display-manager  | select   | nodm             |
| postfix    | postfix/main_mailer_type          | select   | No configuration |
| sddm       | shared/default-x-display-manager  | select   | nodm             |

### Miscellaneous Issues

#### I/O Hardware

Some programs expect to be able to communicate with hardware devices
(e.g., audio interfaces, braille displays).
These need to be tested for functionality on all three
of the expected host operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows).

### Resources

Here are some external resources which could help us in tracking
and resolving issues.

#### GitHub

The scripts and data files that are used to build Perkify
should be made available in a separate GitHub repository.
This would also give us a place to put issues, wiki pages, etc.
For the moment, however, they are embedded
in the [Pete's Alley]{ext_gh|RichMorin/PA_all} repo.

#### The Open Build Service

At the kind suggestion of Steven Pusser (@stevepusser on the
[Debian User Forums]{http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=143406}),
we're investigating the possibility of using the
[openSUSE Build Service]{https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Build_Service}:

> The Open Build Service (OBS) is a generic system to build and distribute
packages from sources in an automatic, consistent, and reproducible way.
It makes it possible to release software for a wide range of operating systems
and hardware architectures.
The OBS reference server, which we use to build our distribution,
currently (March 2019) hosts 62,954 projects, with 527,451 packages,
in 94,872 repositories for numerous distributions and architectures
and is used by 60,034 confirmed developers.

The OBS appears to be a perfect place for interested parties
to collaborate on porting blind-friendly software packages.
If you are interested in helping in this effort, please get in touch!
