Perkify uses [semantic versioning]{https://semver.org}:
each version number is a dotted triple (`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`).
This page mostly discusses major and minor releases.

### 0.2.x

These are "production candidate" releases,
containing about 200 explicitly-requested packages
and about 4000 packages brought in as dependencies or recommendations.
We've made a start on providing support for a11y, audio, X11, etc.
However, a lot of testing and debugging is still needed.

### 0.1.x

These were the initial public releases of Perkify,
peaking at about 100 explicitly-requested packages.
They were basically "proof of concept" releases,
demonstrating that we could generate and distribute a
[virtual machine]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine} image based on
[Vagrant   ]{ext_wp|Vagrant_(software)},
[VirtualBox]{ext_wp|VirtualBox}, and
[Ubuntu    ]{ext_wp|Ubuntu}.
