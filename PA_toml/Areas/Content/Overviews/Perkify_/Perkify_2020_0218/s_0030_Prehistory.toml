Building open source collections has gotten a lot easier:

- No more groveling through random FTP directories!
- Most packages are built, documented, indexed, tested, etc.
- Debian's Advanced Package Toolkit (APT) is phenomenal.
- Arch's "pacman" looks pretty sweet, as well.
- Ruby Gems and such provide language-specific solutions.
