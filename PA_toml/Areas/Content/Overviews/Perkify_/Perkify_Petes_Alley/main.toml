  verbose     = '''
The [Catalog]{cat|:a} area in Pete's Alley has a [Software]{cat_sof|:a} section
containing item pages for assorted applications, software packages, etc.
As is generally the case for our pages, the source file(s) for an item page
can be inspected by clicking on the "Source" link in the page footer.
Feel free to try it out on this page; I'll wait...

Most item pages have only a single file (e.g., `main.toml`).
This contains information used to search for and display the page.
However, if an item page describes an open source software offering
which we're considering for inclusion in [Perkian]{con_ove|Perkian_Intro}
or [Perkify]{con_ove|Perkify_Intro},
an additional file (`make.toml`) will be used.
This file contains additional information we can display.
More to the point, we can harvest it to create software distributions.

### Approach

Perkify is based on an [Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu} distribution,
so its build process uses [Debian]{ext_wp|Debian}'s
Advanced Package Toolkit ([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(software)})
to install most packages.
However, it isn't that much trouble (and actually quite handy)
to keep track of the corresponding information for
[Arch]{ext_wp|Arch_Linux} (and hence, [F123Light]{cat_sof|F123Light}).
Once all of that information is in place,
a script can scan each item's `make.toml` file
and create something like the current `add_ons.toml` file.
Alternatively, it can create something equivalent
for use in the Perkian effort.
What's not to like?

### `make.toml`

The `make.toml` file contains all of the information needed to install
packages using the Arch or Debian tooling.
It may also contain notes on porting issues, etc.
Here is a fairly typical example,
taken from the item page for [Fizmo]{cat_sof|Fizmo}:

    # cat_sof|Fizmo/make.toml

    [ meta ]

    [ os.arch ]

      package     = 'arch_aur|fizmo'
      upstream    = 'https://fizmo.spellbreaker.org'

    [ os.debian ]

      package     = 'debi_pkgs|buster/fizmo'

    [ os.perkify_ubuntu ]

      add_apt     = 'fizmo-console, fizmo-ncursesw, fizmo-sdl2'
