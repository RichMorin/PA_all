### Target User

#### How would you describe your target users?

They would have to be Linux, macOS, or Windows users,
because those are the only platforms that VirtualBox supports.
However, they would have to be reasonably computer-savvy at this point,
because Perkify is still very raw technology.
Finally, they would have to be interested in trying out Linux.

Although we're making a concerted effort to serve blind, dyslexic,
and visually impaired users, sighted users may also find Perkify useful.
After all, installing open source packages can be a lot of work,
particularly for relatively non-technical users.
Having a well equipped, turnkey virtual machine takes away a lot of pain.

Even "serious" Linux users may find it useful to have a turnkey VM on hand,
because adding, configuring, and removing packages can be a big hassle.
More seriously, it can also destabilize the host operating system.
