### Expected Users

#### Does Perkify support naive users?

Perkify's users will always have to be reasonably computer-savvy:
able to run the Vagrant and VirtualBox installers,
deal with a command-line user interface, etc.
And, in the short term, they will have to put up with configuration issues
and other vagaries of early software releases.

#### Do users need to be Linux experts?

No, but they need to be interested in trying it out
and willing to Read The Fine Manual, ask questions, etc.

#### Is Perkify just for the disabled?

Our primary goal is to serve the blind, dyslexic, and/or visually impaired.
However, sighted users may also find Perkify useful.
After all, installing open source packages can be a lot of work,
particularly for relatively non-technical users.
Having a well equipped, turnkey virtual machine takes away a lot of pain.
