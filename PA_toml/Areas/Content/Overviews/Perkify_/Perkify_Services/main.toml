[Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu} is capable of providing a large number of
[network services]{ext_wp|Network_service}, including common ones such as
Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([HTTP]{ext_wp|Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol}) and
Secure Shell ([SSH]{ext_wp|Secure_Shell}).
Perkify starts with the default set and then sets up a few more.
This page provides a summary of the provided services
and associated [ports]{ext_wp|Port_(computer_networking)}.

### Background

The port number field contains 16 bits,
allowing a range of port numbers from 0-65535.
However, use of these numbers is subject to assorted constraints:

> The port numbers are divided into three ranges: the *well-known ports*,
the *registered ports*, and the *dynamic* or *private ports*.

> The well-known ports (also known as *system ports*)
are those from 0 through 1023.
The requirements for new assignments in this range
are stricter than for other registrations ...

> -- [$url]{ext_wp|Port_(computer_networking)}

When a service is running on a virtual machine ([VM]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine}),
it has to avoid the ports that are being used by the host machine.
The VM accomplishes this by using [port forwarding]{ext_wp|Port_forwarding}.
This maps some of the VM's internal ports (e.g., 22)
onto available dynamic ports (e.g., 2222) on the host machine.

### Port Usage

The following table indicates which host ports the Perkify VM uses.

| Host Port | VM Port | Protocol Name | Typical Usage |
| --------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 8080 | 80 | HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) | web server      |
| 2222 | 22 | SSH  (Secure Shell)                | terminal access |

### Protocols

#### HTTP

Port 8080 is used by an [Apache]{ext_wp|Apache_HTTP_Server} server,
providing access to Hypertext Markup Language ([HTML]{ext_wp|HTML}) files
located in `/home/vagrant/_base/html`.
Other servers will, of course, need to use different ports.

#### SSH

Port 2222 is used to access Perkify via SSH.
Note that SSH can also be used to tunnel
[X11]{ext_wp|X_Window_System} and other protocols.
