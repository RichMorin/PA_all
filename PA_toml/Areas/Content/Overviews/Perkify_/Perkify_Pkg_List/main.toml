This page lists the software
that we install on [Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu} (e.g., the "disco" release)
while creating [Perkify]{con_ove|Perkify_Intro}.
We only add a few hundred packages explicitly,
but [Debian]{ext_wp|Debian}'s Advanced Package Manager
([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(software)}) increases this radically
by fulfilling dependencies and honoring recommendations.

This page is a useful starting point
in understanding Perkify's capabilities and offerings.
However, if you want to explore the available and installed packages,
you'll need to learn about some APT commands and web pages.
So, be sure to visit [Perkify - APT]{con_how|Perkify_APT}!

### Inspirations

As discussed on the [Related Work]{con_ove|Perkian_Related} page,
there are several existing attempts at creating a blind-friendly version
of [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux}.
These are obvious places to find packages which Perkify could include.
In particular, I've been harvesting prospects
from the package list for [F123Light]{cat_sof|F123Light}.
This is an emerging operating system
for the [Raspberry Pi]{ext_wp|Raspberry_Pi},
based on [Arch Linux]{ext_wp|Arch_Linux}.
I have also received useful suggestions from folks on several mailing lists.
Finally, the Arch and Debian package archives contain a wealth
of open source software; perusing these often yields inspirations.

### Explicit Additions

The following table provides the category, title, name, and description
for every Advanced Package Toolkit ([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(software)})
package we explicitly install.
Each "APT name" entry is unique and links to an Ubuntu information page
for the package.
The packages are divided into (and sorted by) about a dozen broad categories;
this can be helpful in finding related packages:

- accessibility     - braille, screen readers, speech, ... 
- administration    - network and system administration 
- audio, video      - music players, sound editors, ... 
- communication     - chat, email, messages, VoIP, ... 
- desktops, tools   - desktop environments, apps, ... 
- documentation     - document generation tools and suites
- games, etc.       - game engines and programs 
- images, etc.      - image generators and processors 
- mathematics       - calculators, spreadsheets, ...
- OCR support       - optical character recognition tools
- programming       - commands, languages, libraries, ... 
- terminal support  - emulators, multiplexers, ...
- world wide web    - HTTP servers, web browsers, ...
- everything else   - ... 

*Note:* Don't miss the [Package Index]{con_ove|Perkify_Pkg_Index} page;
it indexes major packages by overlapping topical categories
(e.g., document converters).
