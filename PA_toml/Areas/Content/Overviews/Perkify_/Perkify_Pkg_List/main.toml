[Perkify]{con_ove|Perkify_Intro} begins as a
[Vagrant]{ext_wp|Vagrant_(software)} / [VirtualBox]{ext_wp|VirtualBox} "box"
based on [Ubuntu]{ext_wp|Ubuntu} 19.10 ("Eoan Ermine").
We then add about 200 packages explicitly, as detailed below.
Note, however, that [Debian]{ext_wp|Debian}'s Advanced Package Manager
([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(software)}) increases this number dramatically
by fulfilling dependencies and honoring recommendations.
So, the total count of installed packages is about 4000
(plus the ones that are part of Ubuntu).

Although this page is admittedly quite incomplete,
it should be useful starting point
in understanding Perkify's capabilities and offerings.
Learning a bit about Ubuntu's offerings would also be very useful.
Finally, if you want to explore the available and installed packages,
you'll need to learn about some APT commands and web pages.
So, be sure to visit [Perkify - APT]{con_how|Perkify_APT}!

### Inspirations

As discussed on the [Related Work]{con_ove|Perkian_Related} page,
there are several existing attempts at creating a blind-friendly version
of [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux}.
These are obvious places to find packages which Perkify could include.
In particular, I've been harvesting prospects
from the package list for [F123Light]{cat_sof|F123Light}.
This is an emerging operating system
for the [Raspberry Pi]{ext_wp|Raspberry_Pi},
based on [Arch Linux]{ext_wp|Arch_Linux}.
I have also received useful suggestions from folks on several mailing lists.
Finally, the Arch and Debian package archives contain a wealth
of open source software; perusing these often yields inspirations.

### Explicit Additions

The following table provides a brief summary for every
Advanced Package Toolkit ([APT]{ext_wp|APT_(software)})
package we explicitly install.
The Legend section (following the table) explains the table columns, etc.

*Note:*
Also, don't miss the [Package Index]{con_ove|Perkify_Pkg_Index} page;
it indexes major packages by overlapping topical categories
(e.g., document converters).

#### Table

{% include_relative ./pkg_tbl.md %}

#### Legend

The preceding table has five columns:
Category, Title, APT name, Description, and Flags.
There are about a dozen broad categories;
this can be helpful in finding related packages:

- accessibility     - braille, screen readers, speech, ... 
- administration    - network and system administration 
- audio, video      - music players, sound editors, ... 
- communication     - chat, email, messages, VoIP, ... 
- desktops, tools   - desktop environments, apps, ... 
- documentation     - document generation tools and suites
- games, etc.       - game engines and programs 
- images, etc.      - image generators and processors 
- mathematics       - calculators, spreadsheets, ...
- OCR support       - optical character recognition tools
- programming       - commands, languages, libraries, ... 
- terminal support  - emulators, multiplexers, ...
- world wide web    - HTTP servers, web browsers, ...
- everything else   - ... 

The Title is my attempt at a human-readable title for the package.
(This may vary somewhat from the "offical" package title.)
The APT name is the unique package name, as used by APT.
This field links to an Ubuntu information page for the package.
The Description is an extremely terse summary of the package.
The Flags indicate the current status of the package, in Perkify:

- I - Installs  (installs without error on test VM)
- P - Prospect  (prospect for inclusion in Perkify)
- R - Released  (included in the Perkify release)
- T - Tooling   (part of the Perkify build tooling)
- W - Working   (appears to be a working package)
