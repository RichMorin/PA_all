  verbose     = '''
Perkify has a large number of audio-related packages,
which can connect to each other in a dynamic fashion.
This page attempts to provide a high-level overview of the major players.

The lowest level of audio support in Perkify is the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture ([ALSA]{cat_sof|ALSA}).
[PulseAudio]{cat_sof|PulseAudio} provides simple routing services.
The JACK Audio Connection Kit ([JACK]{cat_sof|JACK})
supports more complex routing schemes.

### Applications

Here is some (sketchy) information on how different applications access audio.
As usual, additions and corrections would be most welcome!

- Emacspeak uses ALSA, through Voxin.
- Orca uses ALSA, through PulseAudio.
- Many audio tools use ALSA, through JACK.
