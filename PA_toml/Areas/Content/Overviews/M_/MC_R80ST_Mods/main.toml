  precis      = "modifications I've made to my BMW R80ST"

  verbose     = '''
I bought my BMW R80ST (a street/trail "airhead") back in 1984.
It's a great, nimble bike, ideal for the "twisties" I like to ride
around the west side of the San Francisco Bay area.
Over the years, I've made a number of additions and modifications,
for safety and convenience.
This note presents the changes, including my rationale and approach.
(I needed to document things anyway; why not make it public?)

### Physical Modifications

Most of the physical modifications are too minor to warrant much discussion.
For example:

- Replaced the stock rack with a larger and stronger one.
- Replaced the stock seat with a semi-custom one by [Corbin]{http://www.corbin.com}.
- Added a [Crampbuster CB 1 Throttle-mounted Cruise Assist]{
    https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GZPH1G}. 
- Added a [National Cycle deflector screen]{
  http://www.nationalcycle.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=25030} (model 25030).
- Added an X-Grip [cell phone holder]{https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006X387ZS}
  from [RAM Mounts]{https://www.rammount.com}.
- Added foam padding to soften the handlebar grips.

#### Mirrors

I recently got a very promising pair of
[mirrors]{https://www.ebay.com/itm/332731623129}.
I'm particularly pleased by the multiple (4) degrees of freedom allowed
by the design.
However, I'm not entranced by the mirror itself.
The body is pointy and small; the lens is flat, rather than convex.
So, I'm thinking about ways to improve the situation.
Probably a good task for [SketchUp]{ext_wp|SketchUp} and some
[3D printing]{ext_wp|3D_printing}...

The installation took a bit of creativity and elbow grease.
I used a pair of metric bolts (10 mm diam., 1.5 mm pitch, 100 mm long),
along with four lock nuts and assorted washers,
to raise the mirrors away from the handlebars and controls.
The threads on readily available bolts don't come all the way to the heads,
where I needed to attach the mirrors.
So, I extended the threads, using a [die]{ext_wp|Tap_and_die} and a lot of oil.

#### Suspension

I'm vaguely considering adding pneumatic suspension,
to even out some bumps on the twisties I ride. 
Specifically, an economical air shock and something like this
[Motorcycle Air Ride Suspension Modification Kit
]{https://hornblasters.com/products/
  motorcycle-air-ride-suspension-modification-kit}.

#### Tail Box, etc.

I added a [tail box]{https://www.ebay.com/itm/362784359966} to the rack,
then mounted eight [J-bolts]{https://www.acehardware.com/
  departments/hardware/hooks-and-screw-eyes/hooks/57931} on the lid
for use with bungee cords, etc.
Held down by some of these mount points, there is a canvas satchel
which has compartments for various commonly needed objects
(e.g., scarf, water bottle).
So, the satchel provides low security, "soft" storage
and the tail box provides (slightly) higher security, "hard" storage.

The threaded portions of the J-bolts extend well into the interior of the lid.
So, I took advantage of this by using them as mount points
for an elastic storage web.
This does a nice job of retaining light (e.g., medical) supplies,
leaving the lower section of the box free for heavy and/or lumpy items.

The web is strung by a single piece of 3/32"
[shock cord]{https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078135PHK},
forming a 9-node [Eulerian circuit]{ext_wp|Eulerian_path}.
That is, all nodes are fully connected to each other,
with no duplicate links.
The circuit connects each of the eight (two back; six side) mount points,
as well as a bolt at the center of the forward (hinge) wall.
Being lazy, I let a [Python]{ext_wp|Python_(programming_language)} script
work out the path.
Conveniently, I was able to use
[this site]{https://www.wikitechy.com/technology/
 fleurys-algorithm-printing-eulerian-path-circuit} as my starting point.

### Wiring Modifications

Most of the significant changes to the bike have taken place in this area.
In general, they have been motivated by adding accessories
or increasing the bike's visibility.
However, I also replaced the fuse block,
to ease maintenance, increase robustness, and accommodate new wiring.

#### Fuse Block

I've been adding assorted lighting and such to the R80ST.
In the process, I became concerned with the original fuse block and wiring.
There were several issues I wanted to resolve.  For example:

- I wanted a good way to add new circuits to the bike.
- I wanted to turn two complex circuits into four simpler ones.
- I wanted cool features such as LED indicators for blown fuses.
- I wanted (ATC/ATO) fuses that were robust and easier to handle.
- I wanted to be able to purchase fuses in a wider variety of sizes.

So, I bought and installed a 10-circuit [Waterproof Blade Fuse Box
]{https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N25TJV3}.
It's quite a bit larger than the original block (5 x 3.6 x 2 inches), so I:

- wired it up via an umbilical cable
- added a protective rear cover plate
- put it in a padded plastic envelope
- lodged it in the battery (etc) bay

In the process, I replaced each of the original pair of fuses
with a pair of new fuses.
I now have four, LED-indicated fuses covering the original two circuits.
Two more fuses supply the USB car charger
and the power circuits for the add-on signal lamps.
At this point, only six of the ten fuse locations are in use,
allowing substantial room for growth.

#### Fuse Usage

The fuse block is organized as two columns, numbered 1-5 and 6-10.
Fuses 1-3 and 6-8 are driven, respectively, by the bike's grey and green wires.
The other fuses are wired directly to the battery's positive terminal.
Here is a rundown of the circuit(s) that each fuse supplies:

1.  green/black: tail lights
2.  green/black: marker (aka parking) light, etc.
3.  relay (LED) power for add-on signals
4.  Jelly Comb USB car charger
5.  (none)
6.  grey/black: rear brake
7.  grey/black: front brake, horn, stock signals,
8.  (none)
9.  (none)
10. (none)

### Brake and Tail Lights

I replaced the stock brake/tail light bulb with a LED version.
I then added a (4 x 4 inch) panel containing a 3x3 grid of LEDs.
The center column serves as a tail light;
the outer two serve as brake lights.

### Headlight

The [halogen]{ext_wp|Halogen} bulb that BMW used is actually fairly bright,
as such things go.
And, although there are LED headlight bulbs that fit the fixture,
the really powerful ones have a huge cooling apparatus on the rear.
Aside from the fact that this doesn't fit, it implies that there is a lot
of heat that has to be disposed of.
Trying this inside the sealed BMW headlight shell wouldn't work well.

So, I purchased a 6" long spotlight bar with 12 LEDs and a slide mount.
I plan to mount this just beneath the stock headlight
and wire it to the high beam circuit.

### Turn signals

I've done a lot of work in this area.
First, I replaced the stock turn signal and indicator bulbs with LEDs.
In order to make the indicator LEDs fit, I had to trim off some plastic.
I also had to replace the blinker unit, to accommodate low-current bulbs.

I then added four 4.15" diameter (truck-style) turn signals.
Each of these has 21 substantial LEDs, facing both front and rear.
They have two light-level circuits: running and signal.
I use the latter for both purposes,
providing either continuous or intermittent light, as explained below.
A simple switch and a pair of diodes also adds emergency flasher capability.

The added signals are connected to a (right/left) pair of SPDT relays,
using the normally closed (NC) contacts to invert the sense of the flash.
This causes the added signals' LEDs to be on full, by default,
giving me very visible running lights.
They also blink off (rather than on) when the flasher relay closes
introducing both contrast and a slight appearance of motion.
In short, these lights are **extremely** visible.

#### Relay Wiring

I wired up the relays using #18 zip cord,
relying on the ridged/smooth distinction to keep track of the wires.
There are three pieces of zip cord, handling the input power
and the two (L/R) sets of turn signals, respectively.
The relay harness wires are color coded and numbered.
Here are the connections, descriptions, etc:

| Connection                 | Color   | Number | Description  |
| ----------                 | ------- | ------ | -----------  |
| block  / ridged - fuse #3  | black   | 30     | armature     |
| block  / smooth - ground   | yellow  | 86     | relay coil   |
| no connection              | red     | 87     | NO contact   |
| signal / ridged - add-on   | blue    | 87a    | NC contact   |
| signal / smooth - stock    | white   | 85     | relay coil   |

### Electrical Accessories

There are all sorts of handy electrical accessories for motorcycles.
Conveniently, there are also two popular, low voltage power interfaces
that make sense to have on a bike: SAE and USB.

#### SAE

The [SAE connector]{ext_wp|DC_connector#SAE_connector} provides
up to 15 A of 12 VDC.
This is a small, [hermaphroditic]{
ext_wp|Gender_of_connectors_and_fasteners#Genderless_(hermaphroditic)},
and well designed lump of metal and neoprene rubber.
A wide variety of accessories (e.g., chargers, compressors, lamps)
support the standard.
The bike has a fused SAE connector wired directly to the battery.

#### USB

A [USB]{ext_wp|USB} Type-A connector
can provide a small (but negotiable) amount of current at 5 VDC,
driving an immense number of devices
(e.g., cell phones, tire pressure gauges).
(USB was dragged into popularity by Apple;
Microsoft had been tacitly ignoring it.
However, it has grown far past its origins.)

The bike has a 6-port "Jelly Comb" car charger,
mounted on the left windshield support.
Originally supplied with a cigarette-lighter adaptor,
it is now wired directly into fuse #4 in the fuse block.

### Minor Materials

The notes above call out only the major components used in these changes.
Here is a list of some minor but important (i.e., supporting) materials.

- crimp connectors (e.g., 1/4" disconnect)
- Euro Style barrier/terminal blocks/strips
- insulated wire (e.g., #10, #18)
- plastic electrical tape, shrink tubing, zip ties
- small hardware (e.g., bolts, nuts, washers)
