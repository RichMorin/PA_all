The material in this sheet was provided by Paul Willett,
an experienced first responder living in Northern California.
Read it, then print it out, fold it up, and carry it with you on rides.
Even better, carry some copies to give out to your fellow riders!

### Enlist other riders

There will be a lot to do, get help!

- making the scene safe
- reporting information
- rendering first aid

### Make the scene safe

Ask other riders to help you with everything!

- Use available bikes, cars, flares, and/or riders
  to close off the lanes<br> at least 100 feet from the accident. 
- Turn off ignition switches to prevent fires from spilled fuel.
- Turn off fuel valves to avoid spilling more fuel.
- Direct traffic around the scene, as necessary.

### Report Information

Gather, record, and report pertinent information.
Report urgent information at once to 911.

- Where are you? Cross street, direction of travel, lane position.
- How many are injured?
- Nature of injuries? Moderate to severe, conscious or unconscious,<br>
  specific complaints of pain/deformity.
- Specific scene considerations: is access difficult for rescuers?

Report pertinent information to first responders as they arrive.

- Locate the most useful witness; have that person report to responders.
- Determine the mechanism of injury. (What did the crash look like?)
- Estimate the directions and speeds involved.
- How did the rider(s) behave after crashing?
- Information on rider(s): name, age, DOB, pertinent medical history

### Render First Aid

- Immobilize the patient.
- Protect airway / breathing.
- Stop any major bleeding.
- Expose the injury to view.
- Monitor the patient for shock.

#### Details

- Avoid moving the patient, unless his airway is compromised.
- If necessary, roll the patient to turn his face upwards. 
- Remove the visor.  Remove the helmet only if necessary for airway. 
- Immobilize head and neck if appropriate.
- Immobilize suspected fractures. 
- Expose suspected injuries; consider cutting away clothing.

#### Stop Major Bleeding

1. Apply hemostatic dressings.
2. Apply direct pressure.
3. Elevate the extremity.
4. Apply pressure to the femoral or brachial artery.
5. Apply tourniquet only as a last resort.

#### Prevent Shock

- Maintain temperature by shielding from heat or cold.
- Withhold fluids; give nothing by mouth.
