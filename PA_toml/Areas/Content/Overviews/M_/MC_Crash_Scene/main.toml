Paul Willett is a highly experienced first responder
(Fire Fighter, Paramedic, Search and Rescue) and motorcyclist
who has been at the scene of many accidents.  
The following material is based on Paul's
"Crash Scene - Life and Death Workshop" sessions, given at
[Doc Wong's Street Riding Clinics]{http://www.docwong.com/st-clinc}.
After carefully reading these notes (twice!),
print out a copy, fold it up, and carry it with you on rides.
Even better, carry some copies to give out to your fellow riders!

### Overview

Your challenge is to make the scene safe,
collect and report information to 911,
and attempt to help the victims.
There will be a lot to do; enlist drivers and riders to help!
Here goes...

### Make the scene safe

- Close off incoming lanes for at least 100 feet from the accident.
  Go around curves, if need be, to provide enough room for drivers
  to slow down and stop.
- Cones, flares, and flashers are helpful,
  but diagonally parked cars provide a physical barrier.
  Motorcycles with headlights and flashers on can be helpful,
  but keep them off to the side of the road.
- Turn off ignition switches and fuel valves on involved motorcycles.
  Keep flares safely away from flammable materials
  such as roadside brush and litter, spilled gas and oil, etc.
- After you have enough cars to form a barrier,
  direct traffic around or away from the crash scene.

### Report Information

Gather, record, and report pertinent information.
Report urgent information at once to 911.
If need be, send riders out with critical information.

- Where are you?
  Street, mile markers, nearest cross streets, nearby landmarks, etc.
  Include your lane's direction of travel
  and position (lane 1 is nearest the center of the roadway).
- What is the nature of the emergency?  How many people are injured?
  Describe the nature and severity of injuries.
  Are patients conscious?  Are there specific complaints of pain or deformity?
- Assess scene considerations.  Will access be difficult?
  Will any special equipment be needed?

Report pertinent information to first responders as they arrive.
Paramedics just need a quick medical summary; police may want more details.

- Locate the most useful witnesses;
  have them stay, record their impressions, and report to responders.
- What happened in the crash?  What was the mechanism of injury?
  What were the impact directions, objects, speeds, and results?
  Did the rider(s) crash, slide, or tumble?
- How did the rider(s) behave immediately after the accident?
  Did they get up and walk around, sit or lay on the ground, etc?
  Are they alert, cogent, and communicative?
- Get information on each injured party:
  age and birthdate, full name, pertinent medical history.

### Render First Aid

- Immobilize the patient.
- Protect airway / breathing.
- Stop any major bleeding.
- Expose the injury to view.
- Monitor the patient for shock.

#### Caution!

- Avoid moving the patient, unless his airway is compromised.
  Try to avoid rotating the patient's neck.
- Roll the patient to turn his face upwards.
  If he needs to vomit, roll him onto his left side.
- Remove any visible obstructions from the patient's airway.
- Open or remove the visor.  Remove the helmet only if necessary for breathing. 
- Immobilize and support the patient's head and neck, as appropriate.
- Immobilize any suspected fractures, using some sort of splint. 
- Expose suspected injuries; cut away clothing (up the outer seams), if need be.

It takes three people to safely flip a body: one person stabilizes the head,
one pulls on the upper arm and hip, one pulls on the leg and knee.
It takes two people to safely remove a helmet: one person supports the neck;
the other spreads the helmet, rotates it back, and slides it off.

#### Stop Major Bleeding

Losing more than two pints of blood can result in shock.
Arterial blood flows faster and is harder to stop.
Here are some things to try, in rough order by difficulty:

- Apply hemostatic dressings.
  If need be, apply direct pressure and/or elevate the extremity.
- Apply pressure to the femoral (inside of the upper thigh)
  or brachial (inside of the upper arm) artery.
- Use a tourniquet only if the patient's life is at risk
  (and note the time for the paramedics).

#### Prevent Shock

- Maintain temperature by shielding from heat or cold.
- Monitor patient for shock symptoms: anxiety, increased thirst,
  fast breathing or heart rate, pallor, sweating, weakness.
- Talk with the patient to calm him and monitor his condition.
- Withhold fluids and food; give nothing by mouth.

### Supplies

If you have any allergies or other medical conditions,
be sure to carry a medical ID card in your wallet.
Here are some supplies you should consider keeping on your bike:

- CAUTION tape, emergency flares and/or flashers, flashlights
- disposable gloves (Latex or Nitrile) and masks; protective glassses
- cohesive bandage wrap, elastic bandages, hemostatic dressings
- cold packs, roll-up splint, tourniquet, trauma kit and/or shears
- cleansing wipes, microfiber cloths, paper towels, package tape, zip ties
- index cards or a small note pad, pencils or pens, permanent markers
