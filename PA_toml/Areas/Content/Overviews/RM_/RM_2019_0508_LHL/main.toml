*Note:*
LightHouse Labs ([LHL]{http://lighthouse-sf.org/lighthouse-labs/}),
held at the [San Francisco LightHouse]{cat_gro|LHBVI},
is a monthly gathering that examines emerging technologies
of relevance to the blind and visually impaired.
This page is adapted from my LHL talk, given on May 8, 2019.
See the [Perkian]{con_ove|Perkian_Intro}
and [Perkify]{con_ove|Perkify_Intro}
introduction pages for current information on these projects.

## Introduction

I tend to introduce myself here as a "volunteer developer",
but it may be useful for you to know a little more about me.

- I'm a semi-retired software developer, writer, and editor.
  - I've been programming for 50 years (and still enjoy it).
  - I mostly use tools such as [Unix]{ext_wp|Unix},
    [Ruby]{ext_wp|Ruby_(programming_language)}, and
    [Elixir]{ext_wp|Elixir_(programming_language)}.
  - I've done a number of projects involving documentation.
  - I've published a number of free software collections.

- I have some experience with accommodation and disabilities.
  - I've had a number of disabled friends and relatives.
  - I'm mildly disabled; both hard of hearing and nearsighted.
  - I've been physically disabled several times in my life.
  - I've worked on several disability-related projects.

This evening, I'd like to tell you about a pair of related projects.
I'll start with [Pete's Alley]{/text?key=_text/about.toml},
a web site for the disabled community.
Then, I'll segue into [Perkian]{con_ove|Perkian_Intro},
my attempt to make computers and cell phones more useful to blind users.

## Pete's Alley

Pete's Alley is a web site for the disabled community.

- My experience with disabilities isn't that unusual.
  - Disabilities aren't inevitable, but they _are_ common.
  - Many senior citizens have at least one disability.
  - Most people have disabled friends and relatives.

- The disabled community is very fragmented.
  - The LightHouse serves the blind and visually impaired.
  - Other organizations serve the deaf and hearing impaired.
  - This fragmentation is understandable, but also problematic. 

- Pete's Alley is a web site for the _entire_ disabled community.
  - Covering various impairments promotes an inclusive community.
  - At present, the site mostly concentrates on visual impairments.
  - More coverage of mental and physical impairments is needed.

- The current site concentrates on presenting curated text and data.
  - The Catalog Area has entries for several sorts of resources,<br>
    including groups, hardware, people, services, and software.
  - The Content Area has sections for long-form textual content,<br>
    including Essays, HowTos, and Overviews.

- The site's content will be curated by volunteer authors and editors.
  - Anyone can submit additions, corrections, or other feedback.
  - Publication requires agreement among the authors and editors.
  - Substantial contributions will be credited in the byline.
  - This process is intended to maintain a high level of quality.

- Pete's Alley is a bit like a wiki and a bit like a set of blogs.
  - Content creation and maintenance are both crowdsourced.
  - However, each item has known, credited authors and editors.
  - Items are expected to be accurate, relevant, and well written.

- Please check out the prototype server for Pete's Alley.
  - The prototype server is currently available at `pa.cfcl.com`.
  - I need feedback on the site's accessibility, design, and so forth.
  - I also need folks who want to be authors and editors.

- Would you like to contribute content to Pete's Alley?
  - Are there any resources you'd like folks to know about?
  - Would you like to submit some well-considered reviews?
  - Are there howtos, overviews, or essays you want to write?

*Note:*
The site is still a prototype, so there are some raw edges.
For example, the site passes Chrome's Accessibility Audit,
but there are some problems I'm still discovering.
For example, I recently found out that I should be using
the `aria-hidden` attribute on my hide/show links.
I expect to fix this quickly, but other problems will no doubt
become evident as folks with various screen readers explore the site.
So, [Your Mileage May Vary...

## Perkian

Perkian is my attempt to make computing devices more useful,
particularly for blind, visually impaired, and dyslexic users.
The basic approach involves making it easy to install software.

- Perkian's immediate goal is to create turnkey software distributions.
  - Pete's Alley already covers [several dozen]{/dash/make} software packages.
  - Most of these are text-based and run from the command line.
  - The packages include browsers, email clients, and much more.
  - The data from their descriptions can be used to drive a tool chain. 
  - The tool chain can create sets of OS-independent
    "[containers]{ext_wp|OS-level_virtualisation}".

- Let's assume that the user has a working personal computer.
  - This might run [Linux]{ext_wp|Linux},
    [macOS]{ext_wp|MacOS},
    [Microsoft Windows]{ext_wp|Microsoft_Windows}, etc.
  - Step 1 is to install the [Docker]{ext_wp|Docker_(software)} infrastructure.
  - Step 2 is to install a collection of containers.
  - Step 3 is to use the added commands, as desired.
  
- The installation needs to be accessible to our users, so:
  - We mechanize and pre-configure everything we can.
  - We make sure that all interaction can be text-based.
  - We concentrate on adding capabilities to the host system.

At the same time, we can work on other approaches and targets.
For example, the Docker-based approach doesn't fit every use case.

  - It may not work well on tiny machines
    such as the [Raspberry Pi]{ext_wp|Raspberry_Pi}.
  - A few billion [Android]{ext_wp|Android_(operating_system)} devices
    don't even support Docker.
  - So, we need to be able to build and deploy "native" packages.

Because [command-line interfaces]{ext_wp|Command-line_interface}
are based on text, they are inherently more accessible than 
[graphical user interfaces]{ext_wp|Graphical_user_interface}.
However, not everyone is a huge fan of the command line.
As an anonymous wag put it:

> Contrary to popular belief, Unix is user friendly.<br>
It just happens to be very selective about who it decides
to make friends with.

- So, for users that don't like the command-line (and vice versa):
  - We can set up menu-driven and web-based interfaces.
  - We can collect and redistribute curated wrapper commands.
  - We can listen to these users and try to meet their needs.

Perkian is very much a Work In Progress.
I can generate a control file for the build process,
but I still need to assemble the corresponding set
of [Chef]{ext_wp|Chef_(software)} cookbooks and recipes.
Feedback and offers of assistance are both welcome.
