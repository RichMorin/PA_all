The Raspberry Pi had several connectors for standardized electrical interfaces,
as discussed in [VOISS - Interfaces]{con_ove|VOISS_Interfaces}.
These include Ethernet, stereo audio output, USB, and video I/O.
However, it also provides a 40-pin digital connector for the
general-purpose input/output
([GPIO]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output}) interface.

The pins can be used to accept and/or provide both power and digital signals.
Although there is no provision for analog input,
the output from a digital pulse-code modulation
([PCM]{ext_wp|Pulse-code_modulation}) signal can be integrated
(using a capacitor) to provide analog (e.g., audio) output.
GPIO pins can also be used to receive and/or transmit radio signals;
see [software-defined radio]{ext_wp|Software-defined_radio} for details.

### Mechanical Details

The pins in the GPIO connector are laid out in two closely spaced (0.1") rows.
It's quite possible to connect single-wire jumpers to individual pins,
but counting pins (to determine the correct position) can be a hassle.
So, I'd suggest getting and using some of the available alternatives.
