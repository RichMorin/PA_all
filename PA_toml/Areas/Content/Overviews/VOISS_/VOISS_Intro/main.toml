VOISS (formerly F123) was started by
[Fernando Botelho]{https://www.ashoka.org/en-US/fellow/fernando-botelho},
a blind "social entrepreneur" who wants to make accessible and economical
computers available to the blind and visually impaired.
He is an [Ashoka Fellow]{https://www.ashoka.org/en-US/about-ashoka}
and has received many honors and awards for his work.

VOISS has recently started selling the [VOISS Classic]{cat_har|VOISS_Classic}
as an assembled product.
However, you may find the [Loja virtual VOISS]{https://store.voiss.tech}
(i.e., VOISS Online Store) page a bit difficult to read until they put up
an English version.
So, I had Chrome translate the page and then edited the content a bit.
This is my recasting of its content;
[YMMV]{https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ymmv-2483722}:

> The VOISS Classic is a talking computer that is completely adapted
for use by the blind.
The hardware is basically a collection of readily available components,
including:

> - a [Raspberry Pi]{ext_wp|Raspberry_Pi} 3 Model B+ computer and its case
> - a [microSD]{ext_wp|SD_card#Micro-cards} card, pre-loaded with F123Light
> - a full size keyboard (with Portuguese keycaps)
> - a pair of lightweight headphones
> - a USB power bank, power source, and cable
> - a custom satchel for both transport and use

> The system sells for $200 to $225, depending on the capacity
of the selected microSD card (32 to 128 GB).
The modular design allows any component to be replaced without tools,
allowing a blind user to customize, extend, and maintain the system.
The system software, based on Arch Linux and other open source packages,
comprises a full-featured operating system, including:
a high quality voice synthesizer (Leticia VOISS) and screen reader,
and assorted text-based applications
(e.g., email software, text editor, web browser).

This is a convenient offering, and I encourage prospective users
(especially Brazilians and other speakers of Portuguese) to check it out.
However, this isn't the only way to acquire a running system.
Indeed, VOISS encourages folks to build their own systems
and train others to do so, as well.
If you can attend (or even help to create!) a local course,
you'll learn useful things and meet folks with similar interests.

In the meanwhile, I have been working on a modest effort
at a [HowTo]{con_how|VOISS_HowTo},
supplemented by some overview pages
which I hope you'll find to be interesting and/or useful.
See the [VOISS - Index]{con_ove|VOISS_Index} page for details.
