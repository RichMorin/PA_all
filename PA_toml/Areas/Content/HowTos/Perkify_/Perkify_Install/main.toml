The [Vagrant]{ext_wp|Vagrant_(software)}-based version
of [Perkify]{con_ove|Perkify_Intro}
uses a [hypervisor]{ext_wp|Hypervisor}-based
virtual machine ([VM]{ext_wp|Virtual_machine}),
provided by [VirtualBox]{ext_wp|Virtual_Box}.
This approach makes it relatively insensitive
to differences in the host machine's operating system.
However, the installation process varies a bit between operating systems,
so this page only provides general information.
See below for links to the OS-specific installation pages.

### Host Platform

The current version of Perkify should work on any host platform
(e.g., personal computer) that:

- has a 64-bit AMD/Intel ([x86_64]{ext_wp|X86-64}) architecture
- has several GB of memory and 25 GB of free disk space
- has supported distributions from Vagrant and VirtualBox

These restrictions allow us to support most modern PCs running
[Linux]{ext_wp|Linux}, [macOS]{ext_wp|MacOS}, or
[Microsoft Windows]{ext_wp|Microsoft_Windows}.
Other host platforms may be supported in the future;
let us know if you have a particular host in mind.

### Overview

There are several steps to Perkify's installation process.

- Determine the current version number for Perkify.
- Install copies of VirtualBox and Vagrant for your OS.
- Create a working directory for the Perkify installation.
