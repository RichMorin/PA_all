Game programs have been associated with Unix since the beginning.
Indeed, one of [Ken Thompson]{ext_wp|Ken_Thompson}'s goals in developing
the first "Unics" (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service) system
was to support a video game called
[Space Travel]{ext_wp|Space_Travel_(video_game)}.

Although Perkify doesn't have a copy of that game,
it does have several dozen game programs.
Let's explore a little, using some Unix command-line tools.
For details on these, simply Read The Fine Manual (RTFM)
using `man apropos`, `man wc`, etc.

*Note:*
Rather than printing the full shell prompt
(e.g., `vagrant@perkify:~$`) below, I'll just use a dollar sign (`$`).
This is a fairly common practice in Unix documentation.

OK, how many man pages can we find for games?

    $ apropos games | wc -l     # display the number of lines
    6

Well, that wasn't too exciting; only six games...
Hmmmmm; let's try a shorter search term:

    $ apropos game | wc -l      # display the number of lines
    68

    $ apropos game | head -3    # display the first three lines
    adventure (6)        - an exploration game
    atc (6)              - air traffic controller game
    backgammon (6)       - the game of backgammon

    $ apropos game | tail -3    # display the last three lines
    tuxmath (6)          - a math game for kids with Tux
    wargames (6)         - shall we play a game?
    worm (6)             - Play the growing worm game

That's a lot more promising, but also a bit misleading.
Although most of these games are text based,
some (e.g., `hangman`) use a cursor positioning library
such as [curses]{ext_wp|Curses_(programming_library)}
to create a 2D "board".
Since these games are likely to be inaccessible to blind users,
I'll ignore them in this HowTo.
In addition, many of these games aren't working yet in Perkify,
due to configuration issues, etc.
In short, Your Mileage May Vary...

### Adventure

OK, let's go on an adventure!

    $ adventure

    Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?
    yes

    Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
    treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
    seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
    and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  ...

    help

    I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
    describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
    like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
    up, or down.  ...

    ^D
    user closed input stream, quitting...

### Escaping a Game

There isn't any real standard for ways to exit interactive Unix commands.
Words like "bye", "exit", and "quit" may or may not work.
However, like most text-based Unix commands, `adventure` will quit
when it receives an end-of-file ([EOF]{ext_wp|End-of-file}) character.
The Control D (aka `C-d`, `CTRL+D`, `^D`, etc.) key combination produces this,
as shown above.
Failing that, try Control C (aka `C-c`, `CTRL+C`, `^C`, etc.).

However, some programs will ignore your attempts to leave,
burying you in piles of goo.
I ran into this when I tried to run a math training game called `tuxmath`.
Nothing I typed seemed to have any useful effect; was I trapped?

Fortunately, there are various ways to escape from this sort of situation.
The simplest one may be to kill off the Terminal tab in which
the `perkify ssh` session (and thus, the offending command) is running.
You can then start up another SSH session in another tab.

Alternatively, like I did, you can try using some Unix lore to escape.
The first thing I did was to hit Command T,
bringing up "tab" (and shell session) in the macOS Terminal app.
(On another host system, I might have needed a different key combination.)
I then typed in `vagrant ssh`, starting up a second SSH session into Perkify.

Using the `ps`, `grep`, and `kill` commands,
I was then able to kill off the offending program:

    $ ps a | grep tuxmath
     2330 pts/0    Sl+    0:22 tuxmath
     2340 pts/1    S+     0:00 grep --color=auto tuxmath

    $ kill 2330

Going back to the original tab,
I found myself presented with a shell prompt (whew!).
Sometimes there may be some residual goo left on the screen.
Running `clear` once or twice may (erm) serve to clear this up...

### Game Index

Here is a Work In Progress (WIP) index to games on Perkify.
The Type may be GNOME, KDE, term, text, or X11.
(Only the text games are suitable for use by the blind.)
The PS (Program Status) column provides a guess
as to whether the command will crash, run, etc.
