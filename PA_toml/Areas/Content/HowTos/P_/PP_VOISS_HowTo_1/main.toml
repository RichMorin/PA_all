This is part one of a HowTo for putting together a F123 / VOISS system.
It covers background information, component selection, etc.
As usual, please let me know about any errors or omissions!

### F123, VOISS, etc.

*Note:*
As of September 2019, the [F123]{cat_gro|F123} folks are in the early stages
of rebranding themselves as [VOISS]{https://www.voiss.tech/en}.
Although this may cause some confusion, stay calm:
their basic mission is unchanged.
In any case, I'll use a mixture of names in this HowTo, as seems appropriate.
When the dust settles a little, I'll come back and edit the nomenclature.

F123 was started by
[Fernando Botelho]{https://www.ashoka.org/en-US/fellow/fernando-botelho},
a blind "social entrepreneur" who wants to make accessible and economical
computers available to the blind and visually impaired.
He is an [Ashoka Fellow]{https://www.ashoka.org/en-US/about-ashoka}
and has received many honors and awards for his work.

VOISS has recently started selling the F123 system as an assembled product.
However, you may find the [Loja virtual VOISS]{https://store.voiss.tech}
(i.e., VOISS Online Store) page a bit difficult to read until they put up
an English version.
So, I had Chrome translate the page and then edited the content a bit.
This is my recasting of its content;
[YMMV]{https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ymmv-2483722}:

> The VOISS Classic is a talking computer that is completely adapted for use
by the blind.
The hardware is basically a collection of readily available components,
including:

> - a [Raspberry Pi]{ext_wp|Raspberry_Pi} 3 Model B computer and its case
> - a [microSD]{ext_wp|SD_card#Micro-cards} card, pre-loaded with F123Light
> - a full size keyboard (with Portuguese keycaps)
> - headphones, a power bank, and assorted cables
> - a custom satchel for both transport and use

> The system sells for $200 to $225, depending on the capacity
of the selected microSD card (32 to 128 GB).
The modular design allows any component to be replaced without tools,
allowing a blind user to customize, extend, and maintain the system.
The system software, based on Arch Linux and other open source packages,
comprises a full-featured operating system, including:
a high quality voice synthesizer (Leticia VOISS) and screen reader,
and assorted text-based applications
(e.g., email software, text editor, web browser).

This is a convenient offering, and I encourage prospective users
(especially Brazilians and other speakers of Portuguese) to check it out.
However, this isn't the only way to acquire a running F123 system.
Indeed, VOISS encourages folks to build their own systems
and train others to do so, as well.
If you can attend (or even help to create!) a local course,
you'll learn useful things and meet folks with similar interests.

In the meanwhile, this page is a modest effort at a HowTo,
supplemented by some interesting and/or useful background material.
Feel free to ignore, peruse, and or research this material as desired.

### Base Hardware

The system's components are mostly commodity items.
You may have some of them on hand; if not, you can get them quite easily.
I'll provide [Amazon]{ext_wp|Amazon_(company)} links,
but clearly you are free to shop elsewhere, find alternatives, etc.

#### Processor Board

Typically, F123 systems are based on a "full-size" Raspberry Pi model.
VOISS optimizes for economy and battery life,
choosing a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
For normal interactive use, the Model 3B or 3B+ should be just fine.
The reason has to do with the nature of the work being done by the computer.

A typical personal computer spends a lot of time and effort supporting
the graphical user interface ([GUI]{ext_wp|Graphical_user_interface}).
Video processing (e.g., chat sessions, streaming content)
also take lots of computrons.
If you're not doing these sorts of tasks,
you get all those cycles back to use for other tasks.
As a historical side note, the [Unix]{ext_wp|Unix} operating system
was developed on machines that were thousands of times slower than a RasPi!

If neither battery life, system cost, nor heat generation is a concern,
(e.g., you keep the F123 plugged in all the time at your office),
you can certainly move up to a faster and more powerful processor.
For example, a maxed-out RasPi 4 (e.g., 2 GHz clock speed, 4 cores, 4 GB RAM)
will be far better than a 3B at processor-intensive tasks
such as data crunching, image processing, and software development.

#### Data Storage

The RasPi uses two basic kinds of
[computer data storage]{ext_wp|Computer_data_storage}.
There are also some variations which I'll discuss in passing.

##### Internal Memory

Random Access Memory ([RAM]{ext_wp|Random-access_memory}) is transient:
its contents are lost when the computer shuts down.
Think of it as the processor's workbench,
holding tools (software) and materials (data) close at hand.
Access to RAM is very fast,
but its size is relatively limited (e.g., a few GB).
The RasPi's RAM is built into the processor chip,
which is soldered onto the main circuit board.
So, in order to get more RAM, you'd have to replace the entire RasPi board.

Fortunately, the hardware and operating system can cheat a little.
Using [virtual memory]{ext_wp|Virtual_memory},
they can pretend that the system has more RAM than it really does.
However, this deception has practical limitations.
If your programs need much more than the amount of RAM on the computer,
at roughly the same time, they'll start "thrashing"
(copying excessive amounts of data in and out).
This will bring the system to a crawl.

##### The microSD Card

When data isn't actively needed by the processor,
it should go into long-term storage.
The default form of this, on the RasPi, is the microSD card.
However, you can also store data on other forms of USB-connected storage.
The most common of these is the thumb drive (aka USB fob),
but there are also disk drives, solid state drives,
and even adaptors that support microSD cards.
In short, you have many great options...

The microSD card is an amazing triumph of technology.
About the size of a fingernail, the current generation of cards
can store up to 1 TB of data (e.g., images, music, software, videos).
This is far more than most users will ever need,
so pick a size that meets your budget and expected needs.
If you're planning to add a bunch of data or software,
get more storage than you think you'll need.
I'd suggest going for at least 128 GB; you won't regret it!

One reason for this is that you really won't want
to change these cards very often.
Aside from taking time and effort to copy,
handling these cards can be a real challenge
(even for sighted and reasonably dextrous geezers such as me).
Having a card slip out of your fingers and fall on the floor
could be anything from a nuisance to a disaster,
depending on its contents, your luck, and your capabilities.
So, getting a card that you don't expect to replace
seems like a reasonable precaution.

*Note:*
There are some sleazy folks that sell mislabeled microSD cards,
so be cautious of Awesome Deals on off-brand cards.
A bargain card may not function at all,
let alone provide all the promised storage.
It might also fail unexpectedly, taking away piles of your valuable content.
My recommendation is thus to go with a name-brand product from a vendor
who will make good on any problems.

#### Enclosure

It isn't strictly necessary to enclose the RasPi processor board,
but it's probably a Good Idea.
After all, the board has a number of tiny and fragile components,
sharp edges, etc.
That said, you should think about exactly what kind of enclosure to get.

If you're sure that you'll never want to hack around with the RasPi hardware,
you can get by with almost any style of enclosure.
Flirc makes solid-looking Aluminum enclosures for both the
[model 3]{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07349HT26} family and the
[model 4]{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WG4DW52}.
The RasPi 4 produces a lot of heat when it's working hard,
so normally you'd want to get a case that includes a cooling fan.
However, the Flirc case for the RasPi 4 solves this problem in a different way:
the inside of the Aluminum case lid touches the top of the processor chip,
providing silent, passive cooling. 

Having said all of the above,
I'm hoping that you're a brave soul who'd like to be able to hack around a bit.
So, let's find an enclosure that allows this
by providing easy access to the GPIO pins, video interfaces, etc.
The [official Pi 3 case]{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F1PSFY6}
from the Raspberry Pi Foundation does all of this.
Although it can fully enclose the RasPi,
it also has removable panels on the top and both sides,
allowing access to the GPIO and video interfaces.

Sadly, I have yet to find a Pi 4 enclosure that provides a total solution
for a hacker's machine.
Of course, it's still early days for the Pi 4, so something may still appear.
Part of the problem is that the need for a cooling fan
conflicts with the ability to add HAT boards.
The best solution may be to get an enclosure such as
[this one]{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TTMRSF7}
and use a 40-pin header cable to attach any desired stack of HATs.
This also includes a power supply that meets the RasPi 4's needs.

#### External Interfaces

*Note:*
You may be tempted to use other external interfaces
in preference to the default approaches.
However, I recommend that you begin with the default interfaces.
Once your system is working reliably with these,
you can try swapping in devices that use alternative interfaces.
If this doesn't work, you can always get back to a working setup.

The "full-size" RasPi models support an amazing range of external interfaces.
Here are some quick summaries of the most popular ones,
with the usual links for more detailed information ...

##### Audio

The RasPi has a single, miniature size (1/8", 3.5 mm)
[stereo connector]{ext_wp|Phone_connector_(audio)#Miniature_size}.
This supplies stereo analog audio and is typically used to support headphones.
Bluetooth is also commonly used for audio input and output.
The HDMI "video" interface can provide high-quality digital audio output.
Finally, the RasPi's general-purpose input/output ([GPIO]{ext_wp|GPIO}) pins
can be used to generate digital audio by means of
pulse-code modulation ([PCM]{ext_wp|Pulse-code_modulation}).

##### Bluetooth

[Bluetooth]{ext_wp|Bluetooth} supports short-range wireless connections,
roughly 30 feet or 9 meters.
It tends to be used for common peripheral devices,
such as headphones, keyboards, and mice.
However, it can also be used to talk to some home appliances,
such as the [Anova Precision Cooker]{cat_har|Anova_PC}.
Until a computer and device are "introduced" to each other,
they will generally ignore each other's presence.
This provides a modicum of security in public places.

##### Ethernet

The RasPi supports
[Ethernet over twisted pair]{ext_wp|Ethernet_over_twisted_pair}.
This provides wired [Ethernet]{ext_wp|Ethernet} connectivity
which is typically use to talk to other computers.
Because Ethernet access is provided through a physical interface,
typically controlled by a network administration staff,
security is seldom much of an issue.

##### GPIO

The RasPi's general-purpose input/output ([GPIO]{ext_wp|GPIO}) interface
is supplied thtough a 40-pin (2x20) set of "header" pins.
Although the pins can be addressed, connected and used individually,
the most convenient way to wire them up is by using a female header socket.
This may be at the end of a ribbon cable (e.g., going to another board)
or mounted on the bottom of a "HAT" (Hardware Attached on Top) board.

For an easy way to get started on wiring up electronic devices,
consider adding a "breakout board" of some sort.
I really like [Seeed]{http://wiki.seeedstudio.com}'s
[Grove System]{http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System},
which uses polarized, four-pin connectors and ribbon cables.
Each connection provides 5 VDC power and ground leads,
as well as two other signals, taken from the GPIO header.
using a HAT and a set of Grove boards lets you avoid
a wide range of wiring errors (and consequent difficulties).

I have the [GrovePi Plus]{http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/GrovePi_Plus} HAT,
which has 15 sockets and passes through 26 pins from the GPIO header
(e.g., for use with other HATs).
Seeed sells more than 100 "Groves", supporting a variety
of sensor, actuator, and interface functions.
They aren't terribly expensive and work with various processor types.
So, you can trade them back and forth with other aspiring hardware hackers.

##### USB

The RasPi provides four [USB]{ext_wp|USB} sockets.
These can support short-range wired connections,
roughly 12 feet or 3 meters (but this can be extended).
It tends to be used for common peripheral devices,
such as headphones, keyboards, mice, and printers.
However, it can also be used to talk to oddball devices
such as cameras, data storage, and tire pressure gauges.
In fact, it can be used to transfer data between pairs of computers.

USB is also used as a convenient source of 5 VDC power.
Outlets are easy to find and come in many forms.
Some devices (e.g., charging stations, vehicle adapters, wall warts)
are explicitly designed to supply USB power.
"USB Master" devices (e.g., computers, displays) supply power
as part of their duty to support "USB Slave" devices
(e.g., headphones, keyboards).

Indeed, the RasPi is powered by means of a micro USB socket.
It can be difficult to get a plug inserted correctly into this socket,
so you may want to leave that end of the power cable plugged in.

##### Video

The RasPi has a pair of ribbon-cable sockets
that support a directly-attached camera and/or display screen.
The cable distance is very limited (about a foot),
but it might serve well for screencasts and online video chat.
USB can also be used to attach cameras and some display screens.
The RasPi's Type D (micro) [HDMI]{ext_wp|HDMI} socket
is commonly used to provide high-resolution digital audio and video.
Typical output devices include display screens, projectors,
and television sets.
 
##### Wi-Fi

[Wi-Fi]{ext_wp|Wi-Fi} supports longer-range wireless connections,
roughly 100 feet or 30 meters.
It tends to be used to other computers, either directly
or through intervening links (e.g., routing hardware).
With varying degrees of security,
Wi-Fi can be used to create or join networks.
For example, one RasPi might browse a website provided by another.

#### External Devices

Now that we've defined and discussed the RasPi's external interfaces,
we can talk about the F123 devices that you would normally use with them.
Along the way, we'll discuss some ancillary hardware.

##### Headphones

VOISS provides a lightweight pair of [headphones]{ext_wp|Headphones}
with an 1/8" (3.5 mm) stereo phone plug.
Depending on your preferences and usage modes, you may prefer to get
fancier (e.g., noise cancelling) headphones or a pair of earbuds.
Here are some economical
[options]{https://www.amazon.com/s?k=headphones+under+5+dollars},
to get you started.

##### Keyboard

VOISS provides a full-size, PC-style, USB keyboard,
with function keys, a numeric keypad, and so forth.
This is a great choice for a home or office environment,
but its weight and bulk may make it awkward for you to carry around.
So, I'd recommend getting a smaller and lighter keyboard for portable use.
Anyway, here are some economical options, to get you started:

- [Foldable Silicone Keyboard]{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SG5DK13}
- [Logitech USB Keyboard for Business]{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006FEPRO4}
- [Mini USB Wireless Keyboard]{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QJ4YJ53}

##### Power Bank

A USB "power bank" is a sealed unit
which contains some batteries and electronics.
The bank can accept power (5 VDC) from a USB source, store it,
and dispense it to other USB devices.
My power bank, like the RasPi processor board,
receives power via a micro USB socket.
The power exits via a pair of standard USB sockets.

A set of tiny [LEDs]{ext_wp|Light-emitting_diode}
indicates the charging and operational status.
This isn't going to be particularly useful to most blind users,
but it isn't all that big a problem.
Just charge your power bank on a regular basis
and you shouldn't have to worry about the details.

This power bank claims to hold 10,000 mAh,
but this description is silly and possibly misleading.
So, let's dig into it a little.
10,000 mAh is shorthand for 10,000 milliampere-hours.
Cancelling out the silly prefix, this becomes 10 Ampere-hours.
That is, the amount of power provided by a 10 Ampere current
over the period of an hour.
Although the bank can only supply two Amperes at any given time,
it can do that for about five hours.

Amazon lists power banks with various capacities, features, prices, and sizes.
For example, here are
a [5,200 mAh]{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CYNBNVW} unit for $10 and
a [25,000 mAh]{https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYGZ6WC} unit for $35.
Having a power bank fail isn't likely to be a catastrophe,
but I'd still pay attention to the reviews before making a purchase.
Bear in mind is that you can carry around more than one power bank.
So, if one bank runs out of power, you can plug in another.

##### Satchel

The VOISS satchel looks very convenient for a portable system.
It holds all of the components in place, so they won't get unplugged, etc.
It can be unzipped for use and closed back up when you're done.
Unfortunately, its design is optimized for the keyboard they chose,
so VOISS has no current plans to sell it separately.

Don't despair, however; you probably have something around that will serve.
I suspect that a small briefcase would work pretty well.
I'd use [hook and loop fastening tape]{ext_wp|Hook-and-loop_fastener}
(e.g., Velcro) to mount the power bank and computer to the bottom.
(Be sure to leave room to plug and unplug the cables!)
The remaining components (e.g., headphones, keyboard, wall wart)
can be pulled out for use and stuffed back into the case for transport.

##### USB Cables

You'll need a few USB cables to hook things together.
One will go from the power bank to the processor board.
Another may go from a USB outlet to the power bank.
Fortunately, USB cables are really cheap;
so, get a variety and find out which one(s) work best for what purposes.
You should also have a USB power supply (aka wall wart) and possibly
a lightweight extension cord, so that you can charge up the power bank.

### Moving On

At this point, you should have a good idea of what hardware components
go into a F123 system, what they are supposed to do, and how to obtain them.
In [Part 2]{con_how|PP_VOISS_HowTo_2}, we'll put the components together,
load up some software, and (try to) bring up a running system.
