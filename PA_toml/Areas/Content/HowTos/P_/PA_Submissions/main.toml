  verbose     = '''
I strongly encourage you to submit both feedback and content.
Don't be shy: bouquets and brickbats are both fine.
In fact, although it's nice to hear about things that people like,
it's frequently more useful to hear about things that they don't.

And, since crowd-sourced content is at the heart of Pete's Alley,
I _really_ want you to submit item descriptions, reviews,
and any long-form writing you think might be suitable.
After a bit of back and forth, you might end up as a published
(and credited) author on this oh-so-prestigious site!

### Feedback

_Please_ submit feedback about Pete's Alley.
If you simply want to send in a comment or suggestion,
just click the Feedback link at the end of a page.
This will open up a page where you can edit your submission.
There will also be a link that initiates a piece of outgoing email,
complete with a proper address and a subject line
that tells me which page you were visiting.

If this is the first feedback you have submitted,
tell me a bit about who you are,
why you're visiting Pete's Alley, etc.
The more I know about Pete's Allies,
the better I can make Pete's Alley work for them.
Besides, building a community is a large part of what we're doing.

#### Bug Reports

Try to pick a relevant page, if you can.
It doesn't have to be the _only_ page that exhibits the bug,
but ideally the bug should show up somewhere on the page. 
Then, in the message body, tell me:

- what you did to make the bug appear
- what behavior you expected (or wanted)
- what (lack of) behavior you observed

If the behavior might be related to your client software
(e.g., browser, operating system, screen reader),
try to give me the relevant names and versions.
This often helps greatly in reproducing the problem.

I'll try to respond promptly (e.g., within a day or two),
if only to thank you for your submission and confirm that I got it.
If you don't hear back from me in fairly short order,
don't be shy about resending the feedback.
Things do get lost in the mail...

After that, things may slow down while I try to replicate the problem
and figure out what (if anything) I can do about it.
I will try to keep you in the loop, however,
so that you have some idea what's going on.

#### Reviews

If you have relevant experience with an item
in our [Catalog]{cat|:a} area, consider submitting a review.
What do you like (or dislike)?
What gotchas and workarounds have you discovered?
Depending on the nature of your comments, I may edit them into the item
or include them in a Reviews section.
Either way, if I use your work, it will be credited.

If possible, your submission should use plain, unstyled text.
Ideally, you should create the review in a [text editor]{ext_wp|Text_editor}
and include the resulting file as an attachment.
([Word processors]{ext_wp|Word_processor} and
[email clients]{ext_wp|Email_client} tend to use wonky characters
that I have to detect and remove.)
That said, feel free to use [Markdown]{ext_wp|Markdown} syntax
to add display lists, emphasis, links, and such to your "verbose" text.

### Items

If you want to submit substantial changes to an item
or create an entirely new item (e.g., an article or catalog entry),
there is more of a learning curve involved.
(I'm working on making things easier, but it's still early days...)
In the meanwhile, however, I'll be happy to help you get going.
Here's a sketchy tutorial, to help you get started...

The first thing to bear in mind is that we _both_
want your content to be easy for folks to understand.
Try to make it as clean and clear as possible,
but don't worry if there are some minor errors;
that's why we have an editing pass.
Before you edit or create a Catalog item, be sure to read the
[Typed Tags]{con_ove|PA_Typed_Tags} overview.
Combinations of types and tags are essential to our Search facility.
This will give you some background on why and how we use them.

#### Getting Started

Submitting changes to an existing item is a good way to begin.
It lets you make additions and/or changes,
while following a layout that is known to be valid.
Once some of your changes have been accepted,
you'll feel more confident about submitting a new item.
To get started, navigate to an appropriate item.
For changes, simply start with the item in question.
For a new item, start with something similar.
For example, if you want to submit a new item
in the Catalog/Hardware section, you might start with the
[Anova_PC]{cat_har|Anova_PC} page.

#### Source Code (?!?!?)

The pages in Pete's Alley are generated from "source code",
encoded in a combination of (slightly extended forms of)
[Markdown]{ext_wp|Markdown} and [TOML]{ext_wp|TOML}.
Markdown is a popular [markup language]{ext_wp|Markup_language}
which frees you from most of the pain of writing [HTML]{ext_wp|HTML}.
TOML is an easy and popular way to encode structured data.
Using TOML, you can enter text (e.g., lists of tags)
in a manner that our server software can digest.
For more information,
visit [Pete's Alley - Extensions]{con_how|PA_Extensions}.

If you aren't a "techie" (e.g., a computer programmer),
you should probably begin by using our online editing facility.
Although it may seem a bit tedious, it is designed to help you
enter all the needed information in the correct format.
You can then examine the resulting source code
and learn about how we like to encode things.

#### Online Editing

There is an "Edit" link in the footer of each item page in `Areas/Catalog`.
Using the resulting page, you can compose, edit, preview,
and/or submit an item for publication in Pete's Alley.
Be sure to put accurate values into the `email_addr` and `full_name` fields
in the `user` section.
This will let us contact you about proposed changes,
give you proper credit for your work, etc.

Fill in and/or edit any other fields that seem appropriate,
then click the "Preview" button.
The resulting page will display the rendered item,
followed by the corresponding TOML/Markdown source code and an Edit Area.
You can edit and preview your work as many times as you desire.

When you are satisfied with the result, click the "Submit" button.
On the resulting page, click the "Feedback" button
and tell us a bit about your motivation, approach, etc.
Typically, after we receive your submission, we'll review it,
possibly edit it a bit, and send it back to you for confirmation or rework.

#### Offline Editing

If you're confident that you understand the relevant Schema file
(e.g., `main.toml`, linked below)
and are comfortable about using a text editor, you can:

- download a copy of the source file
- edit it on your personal computer
- send it to me as an email enclosure

To get access to a page's source code,
click the "Source" link in the page footer.
This will bring up a new page, displaying the page's source code
and offering a "download" link.
Scan the Markdown and TOML to get an idea of the general format.
By comparing the source file with the formatted page,
you should be able to get an idea of its syntax and semantics.

Edit the file on your computer, preferably using a text editor.
(Word processors tend to add weird characters and formatting!)
Finally, be sure to send the file as an enclosure,
lest the intervening mail software decide to "improve" it...

#### Interaction

You should expect a bit of email interaction, particularly at first.
For example, I may need to edit your submission in various ways.
If the edits are substantial, I'll send it back to you for review.
Once everyone involved is satisfied,
the submission will be published on the site.

If you are a new submitter, I will also create a page for you
in the `Catalog/People` section.
This will let the site's other users know a bit about you
(but you get to decide how much information to disclose).

### Schema Files

The "schema files" are the definitive reference
to the syntax and semantics of our TOML files.
Using a simple form of "Schema by Example",
they control and document both acceptable and required content.
Before attempting to create a TOML file for the site,
you should examine the relevant schema file:

- <code>[Area Schema]{_schemas/area.toml:s}</code> - `.../_area.toml`
- <code>[Main Schema]{_schemas/main.toml:s}</code> - `.../main.toml`
- <code>[Make Schema]{_schemas/make.toml:s}</code> - `.../make.toml`
- <code>[Prefix Schema]{_schemas/prefix.toml:s}</code> - `_config/prefix.toml`

Once you are on the "Source" page for a schema file,
you can (and probably should) get a copy of the file
by clicking the `download` link.
Your browser will store the file in its downloads directory,
using a name such as `PA__text_usage.toml`.
Having this file around for reference (e.g., in your text editor)
will help you figure out where fiddly bits of data need to go...

#### Dashboard

The schema files specify the constraints on legal TOML files
(e.g., valid tag types), but they don't indicate which types
are getting the most usage, which tags are showing up in more
than one type, etc. 
The [Dashboard]{/dash} pages contain a variety of informal
quantitative information on the site's underlying code and data.
Scanning its lists and tables will give you an idea of the way
the site is coming along.
In particular, the [Tags]{/dash/tags} dashboard's "Usage by Type" table
is a handy way to find the most popular tag types.
