# Pete's Alley

Pete's Alley is a crowd-sourced resource for the disabled community,
including their friends, relatives, and other supporters.
It indexes and reviews resources, provides a curated channel
for long-form communication (e.g., articles, howtos), etc.

Our [prototype server](http://www.cfcl.com/PA)
provides basic functionality and a "starter set" of content.
We expect both to grow over time, but there should already be enough "there"
there to provide a feeling for the general approach, philosophy, etc.
Anyway, feel free to drop in!
