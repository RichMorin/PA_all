# Pete's Alley

Pete's Alley is planned as a crowd-sourced resource for the disabled community,
including their friends, relatives, and other supporters.
It will index and review resources, provide a curated channel
for long-form communication (e.g., articles, howtos), etc.

Our [prototype server](http://www.cfcl.com:64000) provides basic functionality
and a "starter set" of content.
We expect both to grow over time, but there should already be enough "there"
there to provide a feeling for the general approach, philosophy, etc.
Anyway, feel free to drop in!

## File Trees

The project's files are divided into a pair of trees.
`PA_elixir` contains the server code (mostly Elixir). 
`PA_toml` contains reference data (mostly TOML).
