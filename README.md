# Pete's Alley

Pete's Alley is a crowd-sourced resource for the disabled community,
including their friends, relatives, and other supporters.
It indexes and reviews resources, provides a curated channel
for long-form communication (e.g., articles, howtos), etc.

Our [prototype server](http://pa.cfcl.com)
provides basic functionality and a "starter set" of content.
We expect both to grow over time, but there should already be enough "there"
there to provide a feeling for the general approach, philosophy, etc.
Anyway, feel free to drop in!

## File Trees

Most of the site's files are located in a pair of directory trees:

- `PA_elixir` contains the server code (mostly Elixir). 
- `PA_toml`   contains reference data (mostly TOML).

The `PP_Perkify` directory contains files related to the Perkify sub-project.
